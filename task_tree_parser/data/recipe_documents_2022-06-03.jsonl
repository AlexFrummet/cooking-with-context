Hi everyone, and welcome to the bread-baking club. Think of this as a safe space, committed to talking about—and demystifying—your breads and doughs. It's a vast world with a whole lot of potential for experimentation, but the root of the problem is this: Yeast, mysterious and giving, seems to scare the crap out of people.    This kneads to end! (Please don't stop reading. I had to, just this once.) But in all seriousness, why should it be so scary? People started making bread a long time ago, before computers, bicycles, and shrink-wrapping existed. Our grandparents knew how to make it, and theirs too. Bread is one of humanity's oldest crafted foods, after all, and making great bread for yourself isn't just possible, it's often relaxing and delicious...plus it just so happens to keep your apartment nice and toasty come wintertime.*    *This is not an endorsement of using your oven to heat your home, which would be bad. Please don't do that.    Our goal is to break down some of the basics of the techniques, chemistry, and superstition behind great bread, and make the whole idea of getting your hands in some dough a little less intimidating. This column isn't about baking the right way so much as it is about acquiring the fundamental skills and know-how to bake phenomenal bread your way.      The Basics of Baking Bread at Home    I want to start with a look at the four major stages of bread baking that we're going to be working with throughout this series:    Mixing: That thing we do when we take our raw ingredients—in this case, flour, water, salt, and yeast—and combine them into a dough. Proofing and shaping: Proofing is about letting the yeast eat up the sugars from the flour, and burp out gas and alcohol, which makes the bread rise and gives it a nice flavor. As bakers, proofing is about nurturing and caring for the dough, little-engine-that-could that it is. When shaping, we teach the dough what we want it to look like when it's a full-grown, fully baked loaf of bread. Baking: We start by stabbing the dough we've nurtured and loved, usually several times, and then fling it into a screaming hot oven. Fire, brimstone, and Maillard reactions galore! What comes out of the oven should be airy, crusty, and delicious. Storing/eating: Eat the bread. We made it, we deserve it. Are you going to try not to eat the whole fresh loaf right away, slathered in butter? Well fine, be that way. We'll talk about storage.    These pillars are going to be our template, and as we work through bread formulas together, they're all going to fit roughly into this framework, or we're going to demand to see their hall-passes. Along the way, we're going to talk about some of the vocabulary bakers use to talk to each other in the wee hours of the morning. WTF is a bread formula and who-the-sh*t is proofing? You'll know the ins and outs soon enough.    And speaking of formulas, our first formula is going to be our workhorse: a tasty, crusty, airy, middle-of-the-road loaf that's so versatile you can shove seeds into it or make it into a rye. This bread is delicious as-is, and it'll be a great starting point for trying out your own ideas, making pan loaves or hearth loaves, French toast, bread crumbs, garlic bread, or a classic PB&J.      The Workhorse Loaf: An Introduction    The Workhorse loaf is white bread done plain and simple, with no frills. The following, four-ingredient formula yields two crusty hearth loaves with a nice, open crumb. It uses all white flour, and only calls for commercial yeast...for now. We'll get into the weird stuff in later posts.    All Purpose Flour: 1,000 g (100%)Water: 700 g (70%)Salt: 22 g (2.2%)Yeast: 10g (1%) if using fresh; 5g (0.5%) if using active dry yeast; 4g (0.4%) if using instantTotal Dough Weight: 1,732g (173.2%)    But before we start baking, what is a formula? Is it the same as a recipe? Almost. It's like a recipe, but it's based on ratios (the percentages listed next to our weights above), not finite amounts. Why is this helpful? It's important for two main reasons. First, it makes scaling a recipe up or down really easy. Some days at work, I need to make two loaves of this bread; some days I might need a dozen. Memorizing the ratios in a formula allows me to easily make the amount of bread I want. Second, if we think of bread recipes in ratios, as formulas, it makes it easier to compare different kinds of bread with each other based on how much of each ingredient is present relative to the others—regardless of how many loaves we're making at once. As we get more practice looking at these ratios, it will allow us to alter a bread's formula to achieve certain qualities in the bread. It will also allow us to look at new formulas and have an idea of what it should feel and look like as we move through the process before we even start baking. That means fewer failed experiments.    And that's just about all you need to get started—well, that and some essential bread-baking equipment, including a stand mixer, bench scraper, and some kind of oven-safe, lidded dish to bake it in.

On the heels of my love letter to the ultimate cheesecake pan, beautifully constructed from non-reactive aluminum with a seamless design and a whopping four inches of depth, I'd be remiss not to share my recipe for the ultimate cheesecake. Of course, as per the pronouns peppered throughout that last sentence, what's best is a subjective thing. My work in restaurants shaped my perspective of a cheesecake; I didn't want some paltry slice showing up to the table, no fancier than a given customer could make at home.    I wanted a classic but jaw-dropping presentation, a slab of cheesecake so tall it could set itself apart from the rest before that first bite. And, of course, that first bite had to really count. It needed to taste exactly how someone would expect a New York cheesecake to taste, but better. It had to blow all their other points of comparison out of the water. It had to be creamier, more flavorful, and nuanced, with nothing gummy or cloying about it. If it failed on any of those counts, I could rest assured the grumpy Yelp reviews would roll in. \"Nothing special. Could save some money and make it myself at home.\"    And so, eventually I developed a recipe that delivered across the board, something that is really special. And hey, now you can make it yourself at home.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    I started with a formula that was printed in New York more than a hundred years ago, changing up the blend of ingredients but keeping the overall ratios intact. You can read more about that in my cookbook, BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts, which takes a deep dive into origins and evolution of both cream cheese and cheesecake. Here, I'll be focusing strictly on ingredients and technique—so let's dive in!      Preparing the Graham Cracker Crust    My preferred pan, an eight- by four-inch loose bottom style, doesn't require any prep, but I do like to line the bottom piece with foil. Later on, when the cheesecake has been un-molded, a gentle tug on the foil will expose a nice gap between the cake itself and the pan. This makes it easy to slip an offset spatula underneath, to lift and transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate (please, don't ever cut it into slices directly on the bottom of the pan; it's not good for your knife, and it's not good for the pan).    When it comes to cheesecake, I'm all about a graham cracker crust. The use of cookie crumbs for a cheesecake crust dates all the way back to 1928, making it a perfectly traditional option despite what some purists may claim. I mean, if you don't like it, that's one thing! But with over 90 years of established use, let's not pretend the graham cracker crust isn't a legitimate option.    If you have my cookbook, along with the time and inclination, the crust offers a perfect excuse to whip up a batch of homemade graham crackers. If they don't turn out aesthetically perfect, who cares? You'll grind them to crumbs, and have experienced a low-key chance to play with the graham technique. The effort-to-reward ratio here pays off for sure, as their graham flavor is particularly bold. Plus, the grahams can be made as far in advance as you like. They keep for weeks at room temperature, and even longer in the freezer.    But no pressure! Your favorite brand of store bought graham crackers will do nicely. Biscoff cookies are my personal favorite on lazy days; they have a deep, graham-like flavor backed by notes of caramel and subtle spice, contrasting brilliantly with the gentle tang of the cheesecake. Or, if you're feeling ambitious, give Biscoff-style speculoos cookies a whirl instead.    To make the crust, I don't even bother with a bowl. Rather, I mix the cookie crumbs with salt (to taste) and butter directly in the prepared pan. Once the crumbs have been moistened, I compress them into an even layer by hand. They may feel a touch dry compared to what you might expect, but the crust will absorb moisture from the cheesecake later on, binding it all together.      Making the Cheesecake Batter    Like many of my other recipes, the filling relies on a few less-than-traditional ingredients than you'd normally find in a New York cheesecake. With all these \"hacks,\" my intent is always a dessert that tastes how it should, but somehow more so. For example, I use a small amount of coriander in blueberry pie to increase the blueberry aroma with a sympathetic essential oil found in coriander. Or I'll let rose water intensify the floral sweetness of honey in a semifreddo.    In either case, the goal isn't to make a Coriander Blueberry Pie or a Rose Honey Semifreddo. Rather, the idea is for these ingredients to add depth of flavor and aromatic complexity to the inherent flavors we want to emphasize, so that the blueberries taste more like blueberries, and the honey tastes more like honey.    So when it comes to the \"secret\" ingredient in my cheesecake, fresh goat cheese, please believe it's not meant to be the star of the show or even detectable on its own. Its role in this recipe is primarily textural, breaking up the sometimes gummy texture that cream cheese can develop on its own—who hasn't encountered a weirdly gooey cream cheese frosting, or a slice of cheesecake that somehow sticks to the roof of your mouth?             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    At just 11% of the cheesecake filling by weight, fresh goat cheese is a small part of the whole, serving merely to complement the cream cheese by improving its texture and offering a touch of complexity to the dairy profile, so it's more than a one-note affair.    Because the flavor of the goat cheese won't shine through on its own, there's no need splurge on pricey chèvre from a local creamery, nor should you stoop to a pre-crumbled supermarket brand. Choose a fresh goat cheese that's fresh, creamy, and soft, with a clean dairy aroma and minimal funk. When in doubt, brands like Vermont Butter & Cheese and Montchevré perform quite well, but ask someone at the cheese counter or in the dairy department, and they can point you to something subtle and mild.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Along with my cream cheese and goat cheese blend, I spike the mix with a trio of aromatics: orange flower water, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Again, the goal isn't to make a cheesecake that's perfumy, or lemony, or even vanilla-y. Here, a small amount of each aromatic ingredient creates a blend that's floral and fresh, but a little earthy, underscoring the innate qualities of the cream cheese itself.    To make the cheesecake, I combine the cheeses and aromatics in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mixing on low speed to get things started, then increasing to medium until no lumps remain. Only then will I add the sugar.    Mixing the cheeses together without sugar limits how much air they can take on, so I don't have to worry about big bubbles or pockets forming in the batter. Once I add the sugar, everything's already smooth, so I only need to mix until it can be absorbed.    From there, I take the bowl off the stand mixer to add the eggs by whisking them through a fine mesh sieve. It's an unusual step, and a little time consuming, but it ensures total homogenization of the white and yolks while removing the lumps of chalazae, creating a silken consistency in the cheesecake itself.    Meanwhile, I bring a little pot of cream to a boil. Once the eggs have passed through the sieve, I resume mixing on low and add the hot cream all at once. It's not hot or abundant enough to curdle the eggs, but it will substantially warm the batter, making it runny and thin—too loose-bodied to retain any substantial air bubbles.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Even so, I like to bounce a spoon over the surface of the cheesecake to help draw up any small bubbles that may have yet formed. If you don't see any little bubbles rising to the top at this stage, you're in good shape! If you do, keep bouncing the spoon here and there until they're gone.      Baking the Cheesecake    My recipe differs from most other cheesecakes in that I put the cheesecake onto a half sheet pan to bake at 450°F (yes, you read that right) for the initial 20 minutes. This burst of high heat causes the cheesecake to puff, for a bit of aeration that gently opens its crumb. We're not talking about the giant, fluffy cheesecakes of Japan, but rather a very subtle souffle.    Because this burst of heat is so brief, the internal temperature of the cheesecake never has the chance to climb dangerously high, so it's not as risky a maneuver as one would think.    Still, when I'm done with this step, I shut off the heat altogether and leave the oven door ajar for 10 minutes to vent, before resuming my bake at 250°F. This low temperature obviates the need for a water bath (i.e., a giant pan filled with scalding hot water just begging to slosh around, or at least give you a steam burn).    For that reason, an instant-read digital thermometer is the easiest and most reliable way to test a cheesecake. Insert the probe into the very center of the cheesecake, to a depth of about two inches, and hold the thermometer as steady as you can while giving the readout time to stabilize. This cheesecake is done when it hits an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C), as carryover cooking will push it about 10° higher as it sits.    Testing the cheesecake with a thermometer won't cause it to crack, and the tiny belly button that's left behind will be easily covered by whatever toppings you later choose. What causes a cheesecake to crack? Over-baking, and nothing more. So please bear in mind that the times listed in any recipe are only a guideline (hence the word \"about\") and keep a close eye on the cheesecake as it bakes, checking its temperature as needed to keep it safe.    After baking, let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then slide an offset spatula around the edges of the cheesecake (this helps it settle more evenly). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least an hour (or up to four) before covering it to refrigerate overnight.    That last bit is important. There's no fast way to cool a cheesecake, all the more so for one as thick as this, so don't rush the process. It will need at least 12 hours to cool and set; never plan on making and serving a cheesecake in a single day. If you need something faster, try my no-bake cheesecake instead.    Because traditional cheesecakes require so long to cool and keep so well in the fridge, they're phenomenal make-ahead desserts, so use that trait to your advantage. It's not possible—or desirable—to serve a \"freshly baked\" cheesecake, so if you've got a special occasion coming up, make that cheesecake ahead of time and lighten up your schedule for the big event. So long as the cheesecake is stored airtight, you can count on it holding up for over a week in the fridge (and, with a non-reactive pan like this, prolonged contact with the cheesecake in the fridge is no problem at all).      Serving the Cheesecake    When it comes time to serve, loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan, and place it on something tall and wide, like a large can of tomatoes. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull down firmly and voila! The sides will slip right off.    For me, this is the beauty of the loose bottom pan, as this downward motion sweeps the sides of the cheesecake into a smooth finish, without any outward pressure, as I've experienced with springform pans.    Transfer the cheesecake to a flat work surface, then slide an offset spatula under the cheesecake, and transfer to a serving plate. When properly baked and cooled, it will be sturdy enough to tote in one hand.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Serve the cheesecake plain, or piled high with your favorite fresh fruit—whether pitted cherries, sliced peaches, blueberries, or some fun jumble of everything that sounds best. Make a coordinating sauce by melting up a bit of your favorite jam, or try our fruit syrup for ice cream. It makes a wonderfully thick and glossy sauce for cheesecake, and works with any number of juicy fruits.    From the specialized equipment to the potential for a homemade crust, and the unusual elements in the filling, I'll be the first to admit this cheesecake isn't the simplest or easiest recipe around. But it's one of the recipes I'm proudest of. And, for what it's worth, I'm not the only one a little obsessed with this recipe; Zingerman's Bakehouse borrowed it this spring for a limited edition Father's Day cheesecake.    Every bite is rich and creamy, but not cloying, with a fresh and tangy flavor that seems like pure cream cheese (even though it's not). With the subtle floral qualities of orange flower water and vanilla, and a hint of lemon for balance, it's beautifully aromatic too, and ready to pair with whatever fresh fruit you have on hand.

We fry the grains in batches and season the dish lightly for a perfect texture and flavor.Why It Works  Starting with freshly cooked or well-chilled rice guarantees it won't clump up as you stir-fry it.Frying in batches compensates for the low heat output of Western stovetops.Keeping the seasoning very light allows the flavor of the rice and aromatics to come through.   I've been holding off on doing a full fried rice story for several years now. I'm not really sure why. Fried rice is a great way to use up leftovers; it is infinitely variable, and there are plenty of variables worth testing out. Couple that with the number of rules that everyone says you simply must follow (you must use day-old rice, you must use medium-grain, et cetera), and it seems like the perfect subject for some hardcore testing and myth-busting.    I figure it's time we got started.    Fried rice comes in many styles. In China, it's typically lightly seasoned with salt and perhaps a little soy sauce or another sauce, along with scant amounts of aromatics and meat. In the Chinese-American tradition, you'll find it made with bigger chunks of meat, and much more sauce. It's the former style that I mostly grew up eating, and that's the style that I'm interested in for now.      Rule #1: Use the Right Rice (Almost Any Rice)              Perfect fried rice is all about texture. I was looking for rice that had distinct grains, each with a slightly chewy fried exterior and a tender bite. I wanted grains that were separate enough from each other that you could taste and appreciate their texture, but still sticky enough that you could pick up small clumps with a pair of chopsticks or a spoon.    Fried rice recipes typically call for Chinese-style medium-grain rice, though Thai-style versions use fragrant jasmine, and Japanese-style fried rice can even be made with short-grain sushi rice. I tried making fried rice with all of those, as well as with long-grain rice (standard Carolina and basmati rice) and parboiled rice (like Uncle Ben's). I did not do any testing on brown, wild, or black rice varieties.    I was expecting disasters from at least a couple of batches, but surprisingly, they all produced decent results. Longer-grain rice varieties tended to be the most troublesome, as they fell apart a little bit during stir-frying and lacked the plumpness that gives fried rice its signature chewy-tender texture.    These are my favorite types of rice for frying:    Jasmine: A medium-grain Thai variety that has the perfect balance of stickiness (for easy eating) and individual grains (for superior texture). Jasmine rice brings its own aroma to the game, so should be used in very light stir-fries where its flavor can shine.Medium-grain white rice: The variety you'll most commonly see in Chinese restaurants. Like jasmine, medium rice grains boast a great balance: They're strong individuals, but also good team players. White rice has less of a floral aroma than jasmine, which makes it a little more versatile.Sushi rice: Japanese-style sushi rice has a very short grain and tends to be stickier/starchier than medium-grain rice. This makes it a little bit more difficult to stir-fry without clumping, but the resulting texture is the chewiest of the lot, which can be a good thing.      Rule #2: Plan in Advance if You Can, But Don't Worry if You Don't    I'd always heard that fried rice is best made with day-old rice, and that fresh rice will turn to mush if you try to fry it. But is this really true? And if so, what is it about the resting period that makes older rice superior to fresh rice?    As rice sits after cooking, a couple things happen. First, there's evaporation: The rice gets drier. Second, we've got starch retrogradation: Gelatinized starches that have swollen up and softened during cooking will recrystallize as they cool, turning the rice firm and less sticky. The same things happen with bread; in the past, I've found that most recipes that call for \"stale\" bread are actually really more interested in \"dry\" bread (see my stuffing recipe, for instance).    I wasn't sure what I was looking for with rice, stale or dry. So I tried it. Over and over and over again. To test dryness, I used batches of rice that I set under a table fan at room temperature, which I hoped would rapidly dry out the rice without giving it much of a chance to turn stale. To test staleness, I stored batches of rice for lengths of time varying from half an hour to 12 hours, very tightly covered on plates in the fridge, allowing their starches to recrystallize without drying out. I also stored rice the way most of us do: in not-well-sealed Chinese takeout containers. Presumably these batches would get both dry and stale.    I then stir-fried the batches, one after the other, in a little vegetable oil.              My results showed some very interesting twists. First off, all of the batches of rice that were under a fan (dried and not staled) worked out well. None of the very tightly wrapped batches worked, which indicates that dryness is an essential factor for fried rice. The batches that were stored loosely wrapped for times ranging between one hour and around six hours actually became more difficult to fry properly. After that, they got easier and easier; by hour 12, they were ideal.    But here's the thing: Even freshly cooked rice worked great. In fact, it worked better than rice that had been stored loosely covered in the refrigerator for one to six hours. What gives? Most of my other tests indicated that dryness matters, but surely fresh rice is the moistest of the lot?    Well, not necessarily. Freshly cooked rice spread out on a plate will steam a great deal as its surface moisture evaporates. That's the important part. It's the surface moisture that is going to cause your rice to rapidly suppress the temperature of the wok. It's the surface moisture that's going to cause your rice to stick together.              That explains why fresh rice and rice that's been placed underneath a fan work well. With rice placed in the refrigerator, on the other hand, you slow down the evaporation process. Meanwhile, internal moisture from the grains will start to move outward, adding moisture to the surface of each grain and making the rice more difficult to fry. Eventually that surface moisture will evaporate again, and the rice will become easier to fry.    Here are my recommendations for rice treatment, in order of preference:    Fanned rice: Rice that has been cooked, spread onto a tray, then placed under a fan for about an hour comes out dry but not stale—exactly what you want.Fresh-cooked: So long as you spread the rice out on a plate or tray while it's still hot and give it a few minutes to allow some surface moisture to evaporate, you can make excellent fried rice with fresh rice.Day-old rice: Day-old rice tends to clump, so you'll need to break it up by hand before stir-frying. It's also drier internally than fresh rice, so you have to be faster with the stir-fry in order to ensure that it doesn't become overly hard. That said, if you happen to have day-old rice, it'll make excellent fried rice.      Rule #3: Rinse the Rice    This was an obvious one: Excess starchiness is what causes rice to clump. Nobody likes clumpy fried rice. If you are cooking your rice from raw in order to make fried rice, make sure to rinse off excess starch first. A quick dunk and shake in a bowl of cold water, or a 30-second rinse under a cold tap while agitating the rice, is plenty.      Rule #4: Break Up the Rice    If you're using rice that has had a chance to clump or go stale, break it up before it goes into the wok. This will ensure that the rice separates into individual grains without breaking or getting crushed.    I did consider whether or not oiling the rice while it was still cold before it hit the wok was a good idea. It's not: Cold oil doesn't spread as well as hot oil, so you end up using way more than you'd typically need. Best to break up the rice by hand and leave the oil for the wok.    Once the rice is broken up, you're ready to cook. Fried rice is more forgiving than most stir-fries (unlike meat or green vegetables, it's not easy to overcook rice), but it's still a fast process. Make sure you have your other ingredients ready to go before putting the wok on the flame.    Speaking of which...      Rule #5: Use a Wok    While it's true that woks were not designed to be used on Western-style gas ranges, with their rings of burners, they are still far superior vessels for stir-frying than a skillet or saucepan. Not only does a wok offer different zones of heat (allowing you to push ingredients away from the center when adding new ones), but it also makes tossing and flipping a snap. This is essential for achieving wok hei, the smoky flavor you get from the vaporization and combustion of oil as the rice is tossed in the air.    I use a flat-bottomed wok so I don't have to worry about accidentally tipping it off the burner. The one I use is inexpensive and made of carbon steel, which will darken to a slick, shiny, nonstick black finish with use. (Click here for more info on how to buy, season and care for your wok.)    The one caveat: Woks work best with gas cooktops, where the flame rises and heats up the sides of the wok as well as the base. If you're using a stovetop with induction or a heating coil, your best bet is to use a flat, heavy nonstick or cast iron skillet. Your rice won't come out with any wok hei, but such is the life of an electric cooktop-owner.      Rule #6: Keep Things Hot. Very Hot.    Here is where I've made the most fried rice mistakes in my life: not getting the pan hot enough, and cooking too much rice at a time. Try it and see what happens. Then come back here after you've scraped out the solid clump of mushy rice from the center of your wok.    Cooking fried rice is not all that different from, say, searing chunks of beef for a beef stew: You want to make sure that the pan is ripping-hot before you add the rice, so that the exterior has a chance to brown and acquire some texture before the rice exudes too much internal moisture and ends up steaming instead of frying.    In a Chinese restaurant, with its jet-engine wok burners, this is pretty easy. Even a large batch of rice will sear just fine. Our Western burners typically have around one-tenth the heat output of wok burners. To compensate for this, I use two strategies.    First: heat. I add vegetable oil to the wok (there is no truth in the old \"hot wok, cold oil\" mantra), then heat it up before adding the rice. I'm talking turn-on-the-fan-and-unplug-the-smoke-detectors hot. The second trick is to cook in batches, adding no more than about a cup of rice at a time to the wok, stirring and tossing it as soon as it goes in to get it nicely coated in oil. You're looking for rice that is starting to take on a toasty golden-brown color, with a tight skin around each grain. This will most likely take a little bit longer than you expect it to, so be patient and keep tossing and stirring.    As each batch of rice is cooked, I transfer it to a bowl and set it aside. Once all the rice is cooked, I add it all back to the wok together.      Rule #7: Go Easy With the Add-Ins    Just as a plate of pasta is really about the pasta itself, not the sauce, fried rice is all about the rice. The mix-ins should all be flavor enhancers, not stars unto themselves. In this case, I'm keeping it simple with some diced onion, carrot, garlic, and scallion. If I were adding meat, I'd either use precooked meat (such as diced ham or shredded chicken) or I'd rapidly sear it in the center of the wok before adding my other aromatic ingredients.    Once they've had a chance to warm up a bit in the center, I start to toss them with the rice, stir-frying everything together.      Rule #8: Go Easy With the Sauce              Some fried rice recipes call for massive amounts of soy sauce, oyster sauce, or hoisin sauce. This has never made much sense to me. Why go through the trouble of making sure your rice grains are dry and individual if you're going to then turn around and sog them all up with extra sauce again?    So long as you're using good technique and high-quality rice, you don't need a ton of sauce. For this batch, I'm using a single teaspoon of soy sauce, along with a single teaspoon of sesame oil: just enough to get it fragrant, but not enough to dominate the flavor. Oyster sauce, fish sauce, or other Asian sauces, like kecap manis (the Indonesian sweet soy sauce used in nasi goreng), all work here. Feel free to suit your own tastes. (Some poor misguided souls even like to stir-fry their rice with ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.)      Rule #9: Season Rice With Salt    That teaspoon of soy sauce will add some salt to the mix, but it's not enough to season the whole wok-ful. I prefer to season my rice with plain salt instead of more soy sauce, as salt will not add excess moisture, nor will it distract from other, more subtle flavors in the rice.      Rule #10: How to Add an Egg    Okay, this one technically isn't a rule, but eggs are so common in fried rice that it may as well be. There are many methods of adding eggs to fried rice, but I find that the simplest is best: Push the rice aside, add a little oil to the bottom of the wok, crack an egg into it, then scramble it right in the center of the wok, using the top of your spatula to break it up into small pieces and eventually tossing them with the rice for even distribution.      Rule #11: Add Fresh Green Elements              Just as I add herbs to my tomato sauce before tossing it with pasta, I like to add fresh green elements to my fried rice before serving it. This can be anything from thinly sliced scallion greens to chopped cilantro, basil, mint, or chives, or, in this case, that steam-table Chinese classic: green peas. I use frozen peas straight out of the freezer. (99% of the time, frozen peas are better than fresh peas anyway.)      Rule #12: Toss Well    We're nearly there. The final step is to just give everything a few more good tosses. By the time you're done, every grain of rice in the pan should be separate from the others, and each spoonful should have an even distribution of all of the mix-ins.              This is fried rice that actually tastes like rice, not just a mushy vehicle to transport sauce into your mouth.    This is fried rice the way it's meant to be.        1:30    Click Play to Learn How to Make Easy Fried Rice        February 18, 2016", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Starting with freshly cooked or well-chilled rice guarantees it won't clump up as you stir-fry it.Frying in batches compensates for the low heat output of Western stovetops.Keeping the seasoning very light allows the flavor of the rice and aromatics to come through."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-vegetable-fried-rice-recipe"}

It's 1998. Google is a newborn company that no one yet suspects will influence nearly every aspect of our lives. The world waits with bated breath after Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar. And fancy restaurants all over the United States are serving plate after plate after plate after plate of grilled tuna.    That, until now, we've never had an in-depth grilled tuna recipe on this site is not an accident. It's dated. Add to that serious concerns around overfishing of tuna, and there's good reason to avoid it. And yet a pristine slab of tuna, seared over high heat with a perfectly rare center is a lovely thing. In my opinion, it's okay to make it on occasion, as long as you buy your tuna responsibly.*    *This is a concern with most edible creatures from the sea, but many species of tuna are in an especially precarious situation.    If you do decide to make grilled tuna, you want to make sure you do it right. Tuna ain't cheap—especially not the quality you'd want to eat near-raw after a quick jaunt on the grill—so ruining with bad technique is as close to unacceptable as it gets. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.      How to Choose Tuna Steaks for Grilling    Buying tuna should start with researching sustainability. There are many species and sources of tuna that we should all do our best to never buy, whether from a fish market or at a sushi restaurant. There are far too many details to list here, so make sure to head over to Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch resource to see which types of tuna from which regions, and caught using which harvesting methods, are the most sustainable. I can't remember, for example, the last time I ordered bluefin tuna sushi and neither should you—no matter how loudly that meltingly fatty toro calls to you. I rarely make pronouncements like this, but some types of tuna are under such extreme threat that an equally extreme statement in support of protecting them shouldn't be controversial.    Assuming you've tracked down a source for tuna that doesn't violate the \"never buy\" list, you'll next want to think about freshness. You want a piece of fish that's sushi- or sashimi-grade...except that those terms don't really mean anything. They're marketing language, meant to signal that the fishmonger feels confident that the fish you're buying is safe to eat raw. Whether you trust your fishmonger is an entirely different question.    Then again, tuna is one of the very few fish that generally must be processed such that parasites have been killed by extremely cold freezing temperatures. In this respect, at least, tuna is a safer bet than many other fish we commonly eat raw or minimally cooked.    Now, assuming you've found a sustainably caught and safe-to-eat-when-raw piece of tuna, the next thing you'll want to think about is the size and dimensions of the tuna steaks themselves. Tuna is best when it's still more or less raw in the center, since most of the flesh, save the belly, is exceedingly lean and prone to grotesque levels of dryness when cooked even halfway to well-done (one of the reasons we also like to cook tuna sous vide). That means you want a thick piece of fish.             Vicky Wasik    Ideally your tuna steaks should be at least an inch-and-a-quarter to two inches in thickness, which will allow you to sear each side while still leaving enough meaty matter in the middle to remain mostly untouched by heat. Much like a few extra pounds of flab will help distance your internal organs from winter's biting cold, an extra eighth-of-an-inch or more on each side of your tuna steak will leave you with a solid one inch of more or less sushi-like rawness in the center, which is what you want. (If that's not what you want, you're better off doing an entirely different tuna preparation instead, like slowly poaching it in olive oil; or just buy a can.)      Tips for Grilling Tuna Steaks     Properly Prep The Grill    Setting up your grill for tuna steaks follows the same basic best practices for grilling anything else. You want to preheat your grill and grill grate, clean the grate well with a grill brush, and finally oil the grate. A hot, clean, and oiled grill grate will be much less likely to severely stick to your fish than a gunky, cold one.    Because you want to sear your tuna steaks as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of heat penetration, you'll be cooking over the hottest coals possible. You can set your grill up as a one- or two-zone fire, depending on what else you're cooking. There's little chance you'll need a cooler area on the grill to finish your tuna: as soon as it's seared on both sides, it's done.     Dry, Oil, and Then Season the Tuna    While your grill is preheating, you can prep your fish. It's important to dry the fish well on both sides, using paper towels—minimizing surface moisture helps speed the searing process along and reduces the chances of the tuna sticking to the grill.    To that end, I also like to lightly rub the dried steaks with a neutral oil like canola or vegetable oil. It's just one more bit of insurance against sticking.    Salt draws moisture out of proteins like fish and other meats, so I make sure to sprinkle it on the tuna at the last second. After we've made sure to dry the surface of the fish well, the last thing we want to do is get it wet again before putting it on the grill.             Vicky Wasik     Grill the Tuna Quicky    Your goal when grilling is to get a sear on the exterior as quickly as possible, while minimizing how much heat penetrates to the center. Even with all of the preparations we've made, the fish will still likely stick to the grill grate at first, so do your best to refrain from attempting to lift or move the steaks prematurely. They should release on their own once they've browned well.    If the fish has adhered to the grill grate at all, the best way to release it isn't to try to force a metal spatula underneath. Instead, slide a thin metal tool, like the tines of a carving fork, large culinary tweezers, or even the spatula blade itself, down between the grill grates and under the fish. Then gently lift from below, being careful not to force it if it's stuck on tight.      How Do You Know When the Steaks Are Done?    Because of how rare I think grilled fresh tuna should be served, I don't bother with thermometers. There's nothing to measure: Just sear both sides and then pull it off the grill right away.    Still, I understand that people want a little more guidance than just that. What I recommend is to watch the edges of the tuna steak. Tuna is remarkable among fish in that its color change from raw to cooked is so dramatic. Raw tuna is a deep, dark purple-red hue, but once heat touches it, it comes a light beige. By observing the sides of the steak you can get a sense of just how far the heat is reaching into it. Just keep in mind that because heat will swirl up and around each steak, the exterior edge will still cook more quickly than the interior, so it'll begin to shift towards beige before the inside does.    When it's done, remove it from the grill and slice it with the sharpest knife you have, ideally a thin-bladed one like a slicing knife. I think it's good simply drizzled with fresh olive oil and a sprinkling of salt and fresh black pepper.    No matter how you serve it, remember that there's no rush. Because the tuna is so rare in the center, it's not really something that starts out all that hot in the first place—it's just as good at room temperature, or even cold. If you want proof, look no further than the millions of fresh-tuna Niçoise salads that once dominated restaurant menus. Though I'd suggest making a Niçoise with canned tuna instead. One of the worst things about that '90s trend was that rare tuna ended up in everything, even when it wasn't helping the dish.

As Nabisco likes to remind us, Fig Newtons aren't just cookies: they're fruit and cake. True to that legacy, my homemade version pairs an easy, no-cook fig preserve with a soft dough inspired by yellow cake. Since everything hinges on the concentrated jammy flavor of dried figs, it's vital that you love their taste straight from the bag, so look for brands that are plump, moist, and naturally sweet. I dig Trader Joe's, having found other national brands disappointingly bland.    Along with homemade Oreos, DIY Fig Newtons were among the first recipes I ever tackled on Serious Eats. But that was some years ago, and I've learned a lot about recipe development since then. Namely, how to make a dough that's a lot easier to handle outside of a professional kitchen. Now I'm back with the recipe for homemade Fig Newtons from my cookbook, BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts at Amazon.      Making the \"Cake\" for DIY Fig Newtons    Like the original, these homemade Newtons aren't cookies—they're fruit and cake. To capture Fig Newtons’ unique texture, the batter is made with butter, sugar, orange zest, cinnamon, and honey, creamed until light and fluffy, then blended with a squeeze of orange juice and a few egg yolks. It's a curious combination of ingredients, but one that makes for a cookie that's soft and cakey, with a warm yellow hue.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    The yolks help it taste like \"yellow cake,\" while the subtle use of honey, cinnamon, and orange make for a freakishly accurate match in the flavor department (even if those aren't necessarily the flavors that come to mind when thinking about Fig Newtons; have faith).    Those ingredients also make the dough very soft, so after adding the flour it should be gathered up in a ball, wrapped in plastic, and refrigerated until firm and cool.    The exact amount of time will vary depending on the thickness of the dough, but expect about an hour. It can also be refrigerated up to a week in advance if you'd like to split the project up into a few bite-sized chunks.      Making DIY Fig Newton Filling    Whether the dough is refrigerated for an hour or a day, that leaves plenty of downtime to make the dried fig filling. That's right, dried figs. Since the bulk of their water content has already been removed, dried figs have a flavor and sweetness that is much more concentrated than fresh figs, yet they taste surprisingly fresh in the filling because they haven't been cooked before. To achieve a similar intensity with fresh figs, you'd need to cook the fruit into a jam with sugar, a process that changes their flavor and consistency and makes the filling more inclined to ooze or bubble out of the cake.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    With dried figs, however, you don't need any additional sugar or cooking. Just trim off their stems, cut them in half, and purée with a touch of orange juice and applesauce to give the \"jam\" a smooth, pipe-able consistency (in the fall, you can replace the applesauce with an equal weight of fresh figs to achieve the same thing, but I wanted my basic recipe to be feasible year-round).    For the most Fig Newton-y flavor, grab dried Mission figs; other types of figs won't have the right flavor profile or sweetness. Also make sure the dried Mission figs are flavorful and plump; bland or withered up fruit won't do these cookies any favors. Your mileage may vary, but I've been really happy with the packaged figs at Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.    If your dried Mission figs are flavorful but a little too crusty or dry, the consistency of the \"jam\" may need to be adjusted by processing it with an extra quarter-ounce of water or so. In the end, the mixture should be much thicker than a traditional jam, with an almost dough-like consistency. Like the cookie dough itself, the fig filling can be made and refrigerated several days in advance, then brought back to about 70°F for use.      How to Put the Cookies Together    When you're ready to assemble the cookies, transfer the fig jam to a large pastry bag fitted with a half-inch round tip.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Place the chilled dough on an unfloured surface and knead briefly until it feels cold and firm but pliable, then generously dust the workspace and dough with additional flour.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Seriously, don't be shy here. The dough is soft and a little sticky, so using plenty of flour will make the rolling a lot easier. Excess flour can be brushed away in the end, but you can’t undo a sticky mess*.    *With this or any other recipe for a rolled dough, it will always be necessary to take special precautions if it's above 75°F in your kitchen; for more information, check out these tips for keeping dough cool.    Roll the dough as evenly as you can to create a square-ish shape; once it's about eight inches across, dust it with a bit more flour then flip it over, dust again, and keep rolling until it's about 15 inches square. I find this easiest to do with a French pin, but as with any pastry project, the most important thing is to work with equipment that feels comfortable in your hands.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    It's important to use a ruler for this step. The dough doesn't have to be a truly perfect square, but it does need to be approximately 15 inches square; an extra quarter inch one way or the other isn't a big deal, but if the whole thing's a full inch too big or too small, the cookies will turn out too thick or too thin.    Not only will that throw off the ratio of \"fruit and cake,\" but significant deviation from the proper size will change how the cookies bake, potentially leading to cookies that are either doughy or dry. So do take the time to check the dimensions of the dough as you roll, and don't try to wing it! As long as you use a ruler to keep yourself in line, you won't have any trouble.    Once you've established a roughly 15-inch square, slide an offset spatula under the dough to ensure it hasn't stuck somewhere along the way. Dust off the excess flour with a pastry brush, and trim the dough into four three-and-a-quarter-inch strips.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    To fill the cookies, position the pastry tip just above the dough, about one-eighth-inch from its surface, then apply firm pressure to begin piping, and move slowly down the length of a prepared strip. The placement and speed will force the filling to spread and flatten; if the piping tip is held too high or moved too fast, the filling will come out as a narrow cylinder, instead.    Pipe the filling down the middle of each strip of dough. If needed, you can redistribute some filling if you happen to misjudge the piping speed or the amount of pressure needed to apply it evenly and run out before the end. With damp fingertips, the filling can be molded and portioned with relative ease, then flattened back into shape.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Next, fold the dough over the filling on one side. If needed, dust off any excess flour, then roll the whole thing over like a log, so that the seam runs along the bottom. Brush off the floury tops, then use your hands to smooth the fig bars into a flat, even shape. With both hands, carefully transfer the fig bars to a parchment-lined half sheet pan.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      Cooking and Cutting the Cookies    When I say parchment, I really mean it; the slippery surface of a silicone baking mat will allow the cookies to spread more than they should (as a general rule, I don't recommend baking cookies on silicone, but that's a rant for another day).    Bake the fig bars at 350°F until they're puffed, firm, and very pale gold, without any significant browning around the edges. Immediately cut the warm bars into 1-inch pieces with a bench knife.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Technically you can cut the bars with whatever you like, but it can be hard to maneuver a chef's knife in a sheet pan, and the bench knife is great for scooping up several homemade Fig Newtons at once.    Transfer the warm cookies to an airtight container with a paper towel placed along the bottom and between each layer.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Once the container's all filled up, top it with another paper towel (to catch condensation from the lid), and close it up. This unusual set-up lets the warm cookies steam themselves to soften and retain moisture, while improving their cakiness as well. Freshly baked, the homemade Fig Newtons may seem a little dry, but after cooling in a steamy environment they taste absolutely perfect.    In the end, these cookies come together with a flavor remarkably like the original, with a freshness that can't be beat. They're tender, soft, and cakey, with a gentle hint of cinnamon and orange to play up the concentrated fruitiness of dried Mission figs.    You can find variations on this recipe (including Apricot Strawberry, Blueberry Lime, Cherry Banana, and even \"Pig\" Newtons made with bacon) in my cookbook, BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts at Amazon.

Pantry and budget-friendly meals are always good to have in your cooking repertoire. This recipe, which features humble ingredients but standout flavor, is a great example. Beans and greens are a classic pairing in Italian peasant cuisine (as well as in many other cuisines from around the world), known as cucina povera (\"poor cuisine\").    Brothy cooked-from-dried beans and wilted hearty greens like Tuscan kale or chard, which can last for a long time in the fridge, together create dishes that are simple, quick, filling, and healthy. They can be served as a soup or stew, cooked down to a drier consistency to use as a topping for crusty grilled bread, or, in this case, combined with starchy pasta cooking water for a creamy, noodle-coating sauce.    Like most bean-centric dishes, you'll achieve the best flavor results using cooked dried beans along with the flavorful cooking liquid that canned beans fail to deliver. However, you can always use canned beans and store-bought stock instead, if you don't have the time or dried beans required for making a batch o' beans from scratch.    This pasta starts with garlic and anchovies, gently cooked in olive oil with a sprinkling of dried chilies for background heat. The anchovies give the sauce savory depth that you won't be able to discern in the finished dish but unequivocally make for a better sauce as we found in side-by-side tests. A splash of white wine lends sweet acidity before the beans are simmered to a saucy consistency.    The dish comes together with the addition of torn-up kale, short tubular pasta (we love paccheri for this sauce), and a healthy ladleful of starchy pasta cooking that all get cooked together with the beans until the greens are lightly wilted, and the noodles are al dente and perfectly coated in sauce.

When the temperature dial hits 107°F in my San Mateo backyard it means only one thing: salad for dinner.    The fact that my neighbor down the street was gone for the weekend and had a hyperactive garden overflowing with tomatoes narrowed down my selection considerably. I'd already Caprese'd myself out, so panzanella it was. The classic bread and tomato salad manages to be fresh and summery, but still hearty enough to eat as lunch or a light supper.    Though it's got a reputation as a Tuscan dish, bread salads are not uncommon elsewhere in the Mediterranean. And let's get one thing straight: panzanella is not a tomato salad with bread; it's a bread salad flavored with vegetables.    Bread has been a staple food in the Mediterranean region for millennia, and even though they didn't have modern preservatives, they found ways to preserve it, such as drying it out, so it could last for weeks or even months. Dried, stale bread was as common as fresh. Folks developed creative ways to use their loaves; think of it as the way we might use dried pasta or instant ramen. Dishes like panzanella and gazpacho (which is a bread soup, not a tomato soup!) were the result.    Tomatoes didn't make their way into the classic panzanella recipe until the 16th century at the very earliest (since tomatoes didn't exist in Europe until they were brought back from the Americas), and it's more likely that they arrived far more recently. Writing on panzanella in a 16th-century Italian text, the Florentine painter and poet Bronzino says:    \"Un'insalata di Cipolla trita con la porcellanetta e cetriuoli vince ogn'altro piacer di questa vita.\"    That is: \"A [bread] salad made with chopped onions, purslane [a type of wild succulent lettuce], and cucumbers surpasses all other pleasures in this life.\"    According to the fabulously well-researched* 1999 website FoodTimeLine.org, we in the United States had no clue what panzanella was until the late 1970s. Imagine: most folks in the US were exposed to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes before they were exposed to panzanella!    *Not to mention fabulously Web 1.0.    The panzanella salad has come a long way since then, to the point that it's now an essential recipe of summer for anyone with access to good quality tomatoes. (And let's get another thing straight: good tomatoes are the only kind of tomatoes this salad should be made with.)             Panzanella is at its best with ripe, juicy tomatoes.    Unlike a Caprese salad, in which I strongly believe that anything beyond tomato, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, salt, and pepper will detract from the experience and simple purity of the dish, a panzanella salad can be made with any number of vegetables.    I enjoy making a good grilled-vegetable panzanella, and in the spring I'll make a panzanella with asparagus. Heck, we've even got a recipe for banhzanella, a panzanella salad with the flavors of a banh mi sandwich.    But for today, we're sticking with the modern classic: tomatoes, basil, and bread in a light vinaigrette. How we optimize that salad comes down to the way we treat our ingredients.      Dry Bread Versus Stale Bread: Which is Better in Panzanella Salad?             Cubed crusty bread, ready for drying.    Bread is the focus of the salad, so bread is where my recipe testing started. To begin my testing, I used a very basic panzanella method: I tossed chopped tomatoes, basil, and cubed bread together in a large bowl with salt, pepper, olive oil, and vinegar. Simple and delicious, but not optimal.    Whether you're making bread crumbs, stuffing, or panzanella, most bread-based recipes will call for stale bread. But what does that really mean? Well when it's left sitting out, bread will certainly lose moisture. Drying often goes hand in hand with staling, but the two terms are not synonymous.    Drying is when bread loses moisture. The basic structure of bread will remain more or less the same, but because moisture provides pliability, the bread will become crisp. Think, toast you've left in the toaster oven a little too long.    In fresh bread, starch molecules are inflated with water, like little water balloons. Staling occurs when water molecules migrate out of those starch molecules and into the interstitial spaces within the bread, causing the starch molecules to re-crystallize and form a rigid structure.    Stale bread is tough and leathery, and will become that way regardless of whether moisture actually leaves the loaf entirely. Bread will stale even when it's wrapped in moisture-proof plastic, and as we discovered in Daniel's article on whether refrigeration is bad for bread, it stales fastest at cold temperatures, just above the freezing point of water.    So when a recipe calls for \"stale bread,\" what exactly does it mean? Does it mean actually stale, or simply dry? Or perhaps stale and dry?    To figure this out, I made my basic panzanella salad using the exact same bread (a loaf of ciabatta) stored under four different conditions:              Fresh  Stale    Moist  Fresh-baked bread Bread wrapped tightly in plastic, stored for 1-2 days.    Dry Fresh bread toasted in oven  Bread left unwrapped, stored for 1-2 days.       I also tried making my salad by soaking bread in water and squeezing it out before dressing it (a commonly recommended method).    The wet-bread technique I dismissed right away. While it did help the dried bread revive a little, it also completely washed out any flavor. My vinaigrette's going to be the only thing to flavor my salad, thank you very much.    Of the other samples of bread, the worst was the bread that was stale but not dry. It was simultaneously wet and mushy while also being tough and leathery at the core, no matter how long I let it rest in the dressing.    The fresh bread was the next worst, very quickly losing all of its texture and turning to mush. Of the two dried batches of bread, I found the most pleasant to eat by far was the bread that was dried but not stale.    This makes sense: I came to a very similar conclusion with my Thanksgiving stuffing recipe. Bread that remained un-dried, whether fresh or stale, simply absorbed too much moisture.             A close look at stale vs. toasted bread.     This is good news, because it means that your panzanella salad doesn't require much forethought. There's no need to leave out a loaf of bread so that it actually gets stale before you start.    I also found that bread that was only very lightly toasted and dried had the best overall texture: soft and edible, but crisp around the edges. About 15 minutes in a 300°F (150°C) oven is plenty of time.    And for those times when you have a loaf of already-stale bread that you want to get rid of? Well, turns out that once you add the toasting step, even fully staled bread will refresh itself enough to make a very decent panzanella.      Salting the Tomatoes Intensifies Flavor in Panzanella    Next, I turned my attention to the tomatoes. Tossing the tomatoes directly with the bread is good enough, but I wondered whether I could coax a little more concentrated flavor out by salting and draining them.             Salting the tomatoes draws out juice that will be used in the vinaigrette.    Salting draws liquid out of tomatoes through the process of osmosis—that is, the tendency of a liquid (tomato juice) to migrate across a membrane (the tomato's cell walls) from an area of low solute concentration (within the cells) to an area of high solute concentration (outside of the cells). In other words, salt draws out the water in tomatoes, which makes each piece of tomato more flavorful.    Conveniently, this process takes about 15 minutes—exactly the same amount of time that bread takes to toast in the oven, and incidentally, the same amount of time it takes me to polish off a small, cold glass of wine.    The liquid that gets pulled from the tomatoes, while not quite as flavorful as the actual tomato that's left behind, still has plenty to offer.             This is the amount of juice from salted vs. unsalted tomatoes.    Whisking this tomato juice into my vinaigrette was an instant upgrade. The salad ended up with plenty of ambient tomato flavor, punctuated by chunks of concentrated, extra-tomato-y pieces.      Addressing a Dressing: Making the Vinaigrette for Panzanella    With the tomatoes and the bread tended to, the only thing remaining was to address the vinaigrette. Until now, I'd been keeping things nice and simple with plain olive oil and vinegar, but it could do with a bit more tinkering.    From my previous exploration of how to make a vinaigrette for a simple salad, I knew the most important part is the ratio of oil to water-based liquid. Get that ratio wrong, and your vinaigrette will break, making foods taste wet and greasy. And since I was adding so much liquid in the form of tomato juice, raising the olive oil content was essential.             From making vinaigrette, to adding the dressing and the herbs for a delicious panzanella.    As for flavorings, some finely minced shallots and garlic worked perfectly with the hearty bread, and a small dollop of Dijon mustard went a long way toward ensuring that the vinaigrette stayed smoothly emulsified as I tossed the salad. It's not a traditional Italian ingredient, but hey, go back far enough and neither are tomatoes, right?             Ripe tomatoes, bread, and herbs are a perfect summer lunch or light dinner. Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    This is the kind of salad you want to take your time eating—not just because hot weather demands you take a moment to relax, but because the bread will continue to change texture as you eat your way through it.    The result of my experiment was a panzanella with the most intense tomato flavor of any I've ever had, and a texture that straddled the lines between tender and crisp, moist and meaty. It might not be how the ancient Romans ate their bread and onion/cucumber/[insert ancient Mediterranean vegetable here] salads, but I'd imagine even the most battle-hardened centurion would have trouble saying no to this modern classic.    This classic Italian panzanella, a bread and tomato combo that is peak summer, manages to be fresh and seasonal, but still hearty enough to eat as lunch or a light supper.        1:41    Click Play to See This Fresh Classic Panzanella Salad Come Together", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Oven-drying fresh bread produces a better texture than using stale bread.Salting and draining tomatoes produces more flavorful tomato chunks.Adding tomato juice to the dressing makes a flavor-packed vinaigrette."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-panzanella-salad-recipe"}

Of all the theories of how carbonara sauce came to be—and there are a lot—the most probable is that it's just an old Roman dish using the kinds of ingredients that have been kicking around the Italian countryside for centuries. Add to that plenty of freshly cracked black pepper, a spice so deeply woven into Roman history that it was twice extracted as ransom by invaders, and you have the building blocks of the famed sauce.    But even if you subscribe to one of the other, more spurious origin stories, you have to admit it's a rare and remarkable recipe that includes ingredients—eggs, cured pork, and cow's- and sheep's-milk cheeses—from all four of the major farm animals, as defined by the Major Farm Animal Index. (The 1973 version, not the one from '94, which anyone in their right mind would agree was a hot mess—alpacas at number five? Gimme a break.)    While it's fundamentally a simple dish, the challenge of carbonara is cooking the sauce just enough to form a thick, silky coating on the pasta without accidentally scrambling the eggs. I'll get to how to do that in just a second, but first I want to go over a few smaller decisions you'll have to make before starting—namely, choosing your cut of pork, deciding whether to use whole eggs versus just yolks, and picking your cheeses.      Choosing Ingredients for Your Carbonara     First, Pick Your Pork    One of carbonara's origin stories says that it was created to appeal to bacon- and egg-eating American G.I.s stationed in Italy after World War II. But, as David Downie's great Roman cookbook, Cooking the Roman Way (at Amazon), explains, the dish existed under one name or another long before that. (As for the name itself, the tale that carbonara was named after soot-covered coal miners is equally difficult to prove.)    That means that on carbonara's pork authenticity scale, smoked American bacon is down near the bottom. Pancetta, Italian cured (but not smoked) pork belly, is much higher up. At the top is guanciale, cured pork jowl.    But knowing what's most authentic only gets us so far. What about flavor? I prepared three versions of carbonara, using each of those three ingredients. All proved themselves to be worthy options, though there were differences.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Guanciale, as you can see in the photo above, tends to have the highest ratio of fat to lean meat, which means that it renders the most liquid fat as it cooks, creating a more unctuous sauce. It's also often cured with a more generous amount of warm spices rubbed onto its surface; sometimes it's made with black pepper alone, but the guanciale I used in my tests also had a stronger flavor of clove and cinnamon. Those spice flavors come through in the finished dish.    Pancetta, meanwhile, delivered the purest porky flavor, which most of my tasters seemed to prefer. American bacon, as you can imagine, added a hint of smoke, which is pretty darned tasty in its own right and definitely worth considering. It's also an undisputed natural partner for eggs, even if that's not how carbonara came to be. If smoked bacon is all you can get, there's no reason to let authenticity stand between you and a filling bowl of carbonara.    No matter which type of cured pork you end up using, it always helps to chill it well before attempting to dice it, since fatty pork can be frustratingly squirmy at room temperature.     Second, Get in on the Yolk    One of the biggest differences you'll notice when reviewing carbonara recipes from around the world is that some call for whole eggs and some just the yolks. When I started working on this recipe, I was expecting to just call for whole eggs, since it's annoying to have to decide what to do with leftover whites. We have some suggestions here, but let's be honest: Wouldn't it be better to not have to deal with that?    Welp, sorry to say it, but after side-by-side tests, I've become a yolk evangelist. If you use my recipe (and you should!), you'll have leftover egg whites to look forward to.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    In my test, I made a single portion of carbonara using 100 grams of dried pasta (my go-to amount for one person) and a single whole egg. I measured that egg by mass and made a second batch at the same time, using the exact same amount of yolk. Take a look at the photo above, because it speaks for itself. The yolk made a tight, rich sauce that coated the spaghetti beautifully, though some tasters found it a little too rich. The whole egg thickened into a nice sauce, but was more watery (remember, I used exactly the same mass of whole egg and yolk, so it's not because there was less egg in the yolk-only batch), and there was really no easy way to tighten it up without scrambling the eggs.    My final recipe, which serves four, calls for mostly yolks, with just a couple of whole eggs tossed in. The result is a sauce with an absolutely perfect texture, just thick and rich enough.     Third, Choose the Cheese    Last up are the cheeses. This is a Roman pasta dish, so, to me, it just won't taste right without the salty tang of Pecorino Romano, an aged sheep's-milk cheese. But Pecorino Romano alone has an assertive flavor, which is why I and many others like to cut it with the sweeter, fruitier flavor of Parmigiano-Reggiano. I use equal parts of each and whisk them into the eggs and yolks in a mixing bowl, along with plenty of coarsely ground black pepper.    Okay, now it's time to actually cook the dish.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      Cooking Pasta Carbonara the Right Way    Let's quickly review the way we finish most pastas: First, we cook the pasta in salted water (but don't make it too salty), using only as much water as we need to submerge the pasta. The less water we use relative to the pasta, the starchier the water will be, which will help bind and thicken the final sauce.    Meanwhile, as the pasta cooks, we heat our sauce in a separate pan. When the pasta is al dente, we transfer it to the sauce, add some of the pasta water, and finish cooking them together until the sauce has thickened just enough to coat the pasta. If it reduces too much, or if the pasta is still a hair underdone, we can keep adding more water, bit by bit, until the sauce is just the right consistency and the pasta is at its absolute perfect point of doneness. Then we stir in some grated cheese and serve.    With carbonara, though, that universal pasta-cooking method won't work. (Incidentally, it also doesn't work with pesto, which tastes best if the sauce isn't cooked.) The eggs in the sauce make it impossible to simmer the pasta with the sauce for any length of time, lest they scramble.    What that means is that we have to combine the cooked pasta with the egg-and-cheese mixture and cook it without too much fiddling, so that the eggs thicken just enough but don't overcook.    I've met some folks who swear that you can just toss it all together off the heat and serve it, but I've never been able to make that work. The eggs have to cook just enough to reach a light custardy consistency, and we need some extra heat to do that...just not too much.    There are two ways to go about it. The quickest is in a skillet on the heat. The safest is a trick I came up with while developing this recipe. Here are both of them.     Higher Risk: The Skillet Method             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Let's start with the slightly faster but also higher-risk method: finishing the pasta in a skillet over direct heat. While the pasta is cooking, I crisp the pork in a skillet with a little olive oil. Then I whisk the eggs with the cheese and pepper in a large mixing bowl.    When the pasta is ready, I drop it into the skillet with the pork and stir it around so it picks up the fat and crispy bits. Then I scrape all of that into the mixing bowl with the egg-and-cheese mixture and add some of the pasta water. I give it all a good stir so that the pasta is well coated, then transfer it all back into the skillet.    I set that over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with tongs. The key here is to use the pasta almost like a mop, so that none of the sauce is left in contact with the hot pan's surface for too long. That mop-like effect is easiest with a long noodle like spaghetti, which is my top choice for carbonara, but you can make it work even with short pasta like penne, another popular carbonara option.    You'll know it's ready when the sauce tightens up, coats the noodles, and leaves clear trails behind as you stir it. To help regulate the heat, you should feel free to lift the skillet on and off the heat as needed until you reach that point of perfection. As soon as the sauce reaches the right consistency, transfer the pasta to a warm serving bowl. Like scrambled eggs, carbonara can easily overcook through the residual heat in the skillet.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik     Lower Risk: The Double-Boiler Hack    It occurred to me while I was working on this that I had everything I needed to set up a makeshift double boiler: a pot of boiling water and a large mixing bowl that I can nest on top. As anyone who's ever made an egg-based sauce like hollandaise or crème anglaise knows, one of the best ways to ensure that you don't scramble the egg is to cook it in a double boiler, as the steam heat on the bottom of the top chamber is gentler than a direct flame under a pan. Since carbonara is essentially a savory custard sauce, it's a trick that works just as well here. This is now my preferred method, and the one I'm giving in this recipe. The key is to not drain the pasta pot, since you'll use the boiling water to heat the mixing bowl.    To do it, cook the pasta and pork as usual, and mix the eggs and cheese in a large mixing bowl, just as described above. Make sure to choose a mixing bowl that will nest well over the pasta pot without the bottom touching the water. Then, using tongs and/or a strainer, transfer the pasta to the skillet with the pork and scrape it all together into the big mixing bowl with the egg-and-cheese mixture. Once again, add some of that pasta water and give it all a good toss.    Then nest the mixing bowl on top of the still-simmering pasta pot and stir constantly until the sauce thickens up. You still need to stir constantly, because the egg will eventually scramble even in a double boiler, but this setup gives you some insurance against it happening so rapidly that you don't even realize it before it's too late.    As soon as it's ready, transfer it to bowls and serve. Then eat it right away: This is not a dish that gets better as it sits.        3:23    How to Make Spaghetti Carbonara              Featured Video", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "A sauce of mostly yolks has a richer, silkier, tighter texture than one made with only whole eggs.A mixture of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano delivers that essential Roman flavor without making the pasta taste excessively salty or sharp.Using a large mixing bowl and setting it over the boiling pasta water to create a makeshift double boiler helps prevent you from accidentally scrambling the eggs."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/pasta-carbonara-sauce-recipe"}

If there's one thing I miss most about New York (aside from the pizza, that is), it's the cold, snowy winters. Not just because I love the cold and snow days (I do!), but more because those cold, frosty days make meaty, slow-cooked, rib-sticking winter dishes all the more delicious. And there's no dish meatier or more satisfying than a big pot of ragù Bolognese.    It's an almost Pavlovian reaction for me: As soon as I see the first snowflakes of winter, my feet work their way toward the butcher counter, my arms reach for my biggest Dutch oven, and my fingers make a beeline for that wooden spoon. (How to let all three do this at the same time is something that my brain has yet to work out.)    Ragù Bolognese is the kind of dish I make in vast quantities, jar up, and ship off to family members. It's the kind of dish I'll taste for seasoning, then taste again, then again, and perhaps one more time to be sure, and before I know it, I've eaten a couple servings straight out of the pot and ruined my appetite, only to discover that, nope, my appetite for Bolognese is still alive and kicking once it hits the dinner table.              Let's get one thing straight right away: When I say \"ragù Bolognese,\" I'm talking true ragù.* This slow-cooked meat sauce is almost entirely composed of meat, with just a small amount of wine, stock, tomato, and dairy to bind it together. That \"spaghetti Bolognese\" you get in Little Italy or a UK pub, made with ground beef simmered in marinara sauce, may be tasty, but it's an entirely different beast.    *Of course, even saying \"true ragù\" are fighting words. Depending on whom you ask, whether it's a cook in Bologna or The Silver Spoon cookbook, recipes vary widely. But all agree the sauce should be meat-forward, with minor extra ingredients to enhance—not compete with—that meat.    My love of Bolognese all started back when I was a line cook at No. 9 Park, Barbara Lynch's flagship Northern Italian New American restaurant in Boston. One of my jobs every morning, all through the winter, was to pull out the giant rondeau that fit over four burners and make a batch of ragù Bolognese for the next night's service. (We always let it sit at least one night in the walk-in, for better flavor.) I'd carefully brown three different types of ground meat while sautéing onions, carrots, celery, sage leaves, and chicken livers in a separate pan. I'd mix the two together, then simmer them all down with a mixture of veal and chicken stock, milk, wine, and just a touch of tomato.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    A few hours later, it would reduce to a velvety-smooth sauce, so rich and hearty that only the fattest swaths of fresh pappardelle or tagliatelle could stand up to it.    Over the years, I've tweaked and refined that Bolognese recipe, testing out every variable I can think of to improve its flavor and texture and align them a bit more with my own personal tastes. I've come up with a number of variations on the theme, including this No-Holds-Barred Lasagna Bolognese.    Recently I discovered the oven is the best way to make a rich, full-flavored slow-cooked tomato sauce. What if I were to employ that same technique with my Bolognese recipe?      What's the Best Type of Meat for Ragù Bolognese?             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Bolognese is a meat sauce and the choice of meats is one of the most important elements. At No. 9 Park, Lynch used a combination of coarsely ground veal, pork, and lamb. Why? Veal is rich in gelatin, but low in flavor. It gives the finished sauce a silky, smooth texture. Pork is high in fat, with a moderate amount of flavor. That fat emulsifies nicely into the finished sauce. Finally, lamb has a ton of flavor, but a rather coarse texture. By combining all three, you get a mixture that's flavorful, fatty, and silky—just like you want in meatballs or meatloaf.    But I always wondered: Since veal is pretty bland (not to mention expensive and difficult to find), is there a better way to get both gelatin and flavor into the mix? I knew if I got rid of it, I'd have to find an alternative source of gelatin. This was compounded by the fact that while the original recipe uses gelatin-rich veal bone stock, I pretty much never have anything but chicken stock at home, and I'm not about to spend a day making veal stock for a recipe that takes four hours on its own.    I tried following the exact same recipe, but replacing veal with ground beef and using 100% chicken stock. It was more flavorful, but the sauce lacked its classic silkiness. The solution? Just add that gelatin on its own.    Six full packets of gelatin, bloomed in thin store-bought chicken stock, brought enough body that it was an improvement over a veal stock–fortified version. Ground beef improved the flavor, and pancetta, an ingredient common in many ragù recipes, brought even more flavor.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    What advantages does pancetta offer over plain old ground pork? Cured meat products are a more concentrated source of glutamic and inosinic acids. Glutamic acid—available in commercial form as MSG powder—is the organic compound found in cured meats, cheeses, and seafood, that's largely responsible for making things taste umami (a.k.a. savory), while inosinic acid acts as a backup singer, increasing glutamic acid's effects.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I tried incorporating pancetta in various ways: grinding it, finely chopping it in a food processor, and adding a simple dice. The third method is the easiest, and melts into the sauce as it cooks.    In the original No. 9 Park recipe, the meat is cooked in a separate pan from the vegetables. This kind of compartmentalized cooking is pretty common in a restaurant kitchen, as cooking like with like—meat with meat and veg with veg—gives you immediate control over how much those ingredients are cooked when working in large batches.    I'm not a fan of retaining unnecessary restaurant techniques for home use, but in this case, it works well, especially since I like to make my ragù in large batches.      How to Use Liver in Ragù Bolognese    This takes us to what many folks who have tried Barbara Lynch's recipe would consider the key element. The, er...Barbara Lynch-pin, if you will (sorry): chicken livers. It's an ingredient that Pellegrino Artusi recommended in his 1891 cookbook Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well, which includes one of the first printed recipes for ragù Bolognese. Chicken livers don't make it into many modern recipes.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Liver adds flavor and depth to the sauce in a way that sits in the background. Nobody who tastes the sauce would ever suspect that there are livers in it—unless they happen to bite into a chunk of one.    In the restaurant, I'd carefully clean and trim the veins and connective tissue from each liver before finely chopping them all by hand. Now I find it easier to blend them into a smooth purée using an immersion blender.      What's the Best Cooking Liquid for Ragù Bolognese?    Now we get to the most contentious element in any ragù Bolognese recipe: the liquid. Do we use wine? White or red? What about milk? Does it really keep the meat tender? What about tomatoes?    I can't answer any of these questions in a valid way, but I can tell you what I've found produces the best results, based on years of testing, reading, tasting, and researching.    First off: the wine.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    It makes almost no difference whether you use red or white. So long as you're starting with something dry and relatively oak-free, the color of the wine has little impact on the final flavor or appearance of the finished sauce.    Whether you go with red or white, wine is an essential element, adding a touch of brightness and acidity to balance the heaviness of the meat.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Tomatoes are the other acidic element in the mix. The Silver Spoon's classic recipe calls for no other liquid than some tomato paste and water or stock to thin it out. I prefer to use canned peeled whole tomatoes, preferably high-quality ones, like imported Italian D.O.P. San Marzanos.    The gelatin-enriched stock makes up the bulk of the liquid. As that stock reduces, it becomes more intense in both flavor and texture.    And now to the most controversial element: dairy.    Okay, so it's not that controversial. Almost all modern recipes for ragù Bolognese call for dairy in one form or another, whether it's milk or cream. What is controversial is exactly what effect dairy has. Many sources claim that adding milk to the pot at the beginning of the cooking process helps keep the meat tender, though very few offer an explanation as to why.    The closest I could find to an explanation was this bit from Cook's Illustrated:    \"Why does milk make meat tender? Browning adds flavor, but it also causes the protein molecules in ground meat to denature. As the proteins unwind, they link up to create a tighter network and squeeze out some of the water in the meat. Long simmering allows some of that liquid to be reabsorbed. But if you skip the browning and cook the meat in milk (or any other liquid) at the outset, you limit the temperature of the meat to about 212 degrees. As a result, meat cooked in milk does not dry out and toughen but remains tender.\"    If you read it closely, you'll realize that, at best, the section should probably be retitled \"Why does meat cooked in any liquid stay more tender than meat that you brown?\"    I prefer to get my science the old-fashioned way: through ordinary experimenting. I cooked up a few batches of ragù using different ratios of liquids, from 100% milk to 100% stock. Turns out, the liquid you cook the meat in has absolutely no bearing on how tender the result. Meat cooked in stock is indistinguishable from meat cooked in milk.    That said, adding milk to the cooking liquid and letting it reduce does have an effect on the finished flavor of the ragù, giving it a more rounded profile and silkier texture. Perhaps it's the silkiness of the liquid in your mouth that tricks some people into believing that the meat itself is more tender?             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Either way, it's clear that adding milk is a good thing.      How to Get Tender and Flavorful Meat    And now we get to the most crucial phase of the process: the long cook. Browning meat adds flavor, but can toughen it. How do we get great browned flavor without reducing the tender meat to dry rubble?    The whole reason I was extra excited for Bolognese season to start this year was because of a new red sauce technique I developed simmering it in the oven instead of the stovetop.    Not only does the oven deliver more even heat and better reduction with less mess, it also creates delicious caramelized bits of tomato on the surface of the sauce and around the edges of the pot, which you can stir back into the finished sauce for richer, deeper, more complex flavor.    What if I were to do the exact same thing to my Bolognese? In theory the technique should provide plenty of flavor through the browning of stray proteins and sugars stuck to the inside edges of the pot, along with whatever small bits of meat are exposed on the surface of the simmering sauce, while keeping the vast majority of the meat submerged and tender.    Don't you just love it when your theories end up panning out in real life? By cooking down the sauce in the oven and scraping around the edges as it cooked, I ended up with a finished sauce that was packed with browned-meat flavor, but still silky and tender.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    This is what your sauce should look like when it's done. It'll start out watery and milky-looking, and as it slowly cooks down over the course of a few hours, that liquid will eventually reduce so much that it can't emulsify anymore with the released fat from the meat. When that fat forms a thick layer on top of ultra-thick sauce, you're ready to continue.    Back at No. 9 Park, we'd throw the sauce into the walk-in refrigerator to cool it down, letting that fat solidify so we could remove it and stir back in a measured amount when reheating each individual order. At home, I skim off and discard all but about one cup from the finished sauce—just enough to make it rich and flavorful, but not greasy-tasting. This can be done immediately with liquid fat, or the solid fat at the top can be removed after a night in the refrigerator.      Making Ragù Bolognese Even More Flavorful             Things are looking good, but we're not quite finished yet. Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    There's already parsley in the cooked the vegetables, but fresh parsley thrown in after cooking adds another dimension of herbal flavor. (Fresh sage added at this stage is overpowering.) Grated Parmesan also increases the sauce's umami, while helping to bind it.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I like to finish my sauce with a glug of heavy cream. It makes the sauce richer and helps emulsify it, allowing that extra cup of fat you retained to integrate harmoniously.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Finally, we get to the secret ingredient. If you are from Bologna, now is a good time to avert your eyes: fish sauce. Yes, fish sauce. I'm talking the salty Southeast Asian condiment made from fermented anchovies.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    From a flavor perspective, it makes sense. Fish sauce is loaded with those glutamates and inosinates we talked about earlier. It brings an unparalleled meatiness to your finished sauce, and it will not make it taste like fish. Moreover, in Italian cooking, it's not really that far out of place. There are plenty of Italian dishes that call for enhancing meat with a bit of glutamate-rich seafood. Fermented anchovies are widely used in Southern Italian cooking. And if we look to ancient Roman history, we find that fish sauce is similar to garum, the condiment of choice back then, made from—you guessed it—fermented anchovies.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    So what do you do with a sauce like this? If you want to make some friends and loved ones very happy, serve it up with the best fresh pasta you can make or buy, preferably a wide, thick shape, like pappardelle. (Here's a trick: Buy fresh lasagna noodles and cut them into one-inch ribbons by hand.) Ridged dry pasta, like penne rigate or rigatoni, work well, too.      Dressing Pasta in Ragù Bolognese    Cook pasta in some well-salted water (and, whatever anyone tells you, do not make that water as salty as the sea if you want your pasta edible—the sea is much saltier than folks think it is), then drain it, reserving some of the starchy liquid. Return it to the pot, add most of your sauce, thin it out with the pasta-cooking liquid, and cook at a hard simmer for about 30 seconds, until the sauce gets a nice pasta-coating texture.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    This is the kind of sauce that not only delivers on the promise of deliciousness while you're eating it, but also makes your entire house smell wonderful for the four to five hours it takes to cook, and for days after you're done. It's totally intoxicating and absorbing.             Serious Eats / J.

Biryanis comprise a category of highly aromatic rice and meat dishes, typically served during special occasions; when I was growing up my family would eat biryani during the festival of Eid or at other celebrations. From a cook’s and a science standpoint, I find biryanis to be interesting because their emphasis lies in carefully building up layers of aromas and flavors and celebrating combinations of textures and colors—in a good biryani, every aspect of the dish is splendidly executed. Let’s take a closer look at what makes a biryani so special.      What Is Biryani?    Biryani is a South Asian one-pot dish in which lamb, mutton, beef, chicken, seafood, or a mixture of vegetables is layered with rice. The layering technique is what differentiates biryani from other rice dishes, like a pilaf or pulao.    There are a couple of different ways to prepare biryani. Sometimes the raw meat is cooked with the rice; this is called the \"kacchi\" method (kacchi is Hindi for \"raw\"). In others, the meat is cooked separately, as I do in this recipe; this is called the \"pakki\" method (pakki is Hindi for \"cooked\"). Regardless of the method, aromas are infused into the meat and the rice using a combination of spices, herbs, and extracts, while saffron threads and turmeric add bright hues of orange and yellow to the otherwise white backdrop of long-grain rice. The result is a highly aromatic and colorful dish of meat and rice. There are a lot of variations of biryani—like Bombay biryani, Hyderbadi biryani, etc.—as recipes and taste preferences can be quite different from region to region and even household to household.      Building Flavors in Biryani     The Yogurt Marinade    The first step in preparing my lamb biryani involves marinating the meat in a mixture of yogurt, salt, ginger, and garlic in the refrigerator overnight. Yogurt is a mixture of lactic acid, fat, enzymes, and proteins, all of which work in concert to tenderize the meat and imbue it with flavor. Some recipes will utilize raw papaya as a meat tenderizer for tougher cuts of beef, mutton, or lamb, as it contains the tenderizing enzyme papain, but I have found it unnecessary.    When testing the recipe, I was curious to see if marinating the meat in yogurt affected the time needed for the lamb to become tender, and, on average, marinating the meat in yogurt and salt overnight in the refrigerator cut back my cooking time by at least an hour. You can use either Greek yogurt or regular plain yogurt for marinating the meat; I haven’t noticed any differences between the two, but you will need to add about an extra half cup of water or stock if you use Greek yogurt to ensure you have enough cooking liquid.     Onions    The next important stage of flavor development is the browning of the onions. As the onions heat, caramelization (a flavor-producing reaction that involves sugars like fructose and glucose) and the Maillard reaction kick in, which help produce bittersweet notes and brown colored pigments in the sugars. (Onions are rich in long chains or polymers called fructans, made up of the sugar fructose, and also contain glucose and fructose.) The darker the browning, the stronger the flavor of the onions, but be careful: if they turn dark black, they will taste unpleasantly bitter.     Basmati Rice             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    For the layer of rice, it’s important that you use basmati, a long-grain, aromatic rice variety commonly used in the subcontinent. Basmati rice brands will often describe their product as \"aged,\" which gives a sense of the quality. One of the aroma molecules responsible for the aroma of basmati rice is 2-AP (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline), and the aroma of basmati tends to get stronger as the uncooked grains of rice are stored; typically basmati rice is aged for up to a year or more. (Interestingly, 2-AP is also present in the pandan water used to add aromatic complexity to biryanis). Aged basmati rice also absorbs water much better: the grains don’t stick as much when cooking, and the cooked grains are firmer.    Basmati rice will expand in length as it absorbs water and cooks, but it won’t get as puffy as short-grain rice or turn sticky (this is because at least 73% of the starch content in basmati rice is made up of amylose, which is present at very low levels in short-grain rice varieties). When I cook the rice, I add a little bit of citric acid, in the form of lemon or lime juice, and fat to the water to further help the rice from overcooking and splitting— the citric acid works primarily on the starch while the fat helps coat the grains and prevents them from sticking.      Adding Aroma and Color    Aromas and colors are a very important component of biryani preparation. Spices, like cardamom, cinnamon, and mace, and fresh herbs, like cilantro and mint, imbue the meat with their aromas as it cooks. There are two more aromatic ingredients of significance added to the biryani: rosewater and pandan (also called screwpine or kewra) water. These are sprinkled over the rice just before it steams, and the combination results in a highly fragrant biryani.    For color, the curcumin pigment in the turmeric that’s added to the meat will stain some of the rice grains yellow. A second source of color comes from the delicate threads of saffron, which contain crocetin, a fat-soluble pigment that is extracted by the fat present in hot milk; the milk is also sprinkled over the layer of rice along with the rosewater and pandan water. To get a richer color from the saffron, I grind a few threads separately and then add them to the milk to get a stronger extract.      Finishing Biryani With Steam    Once the meat and rice are layered together, the entire pot is sealed tight with a double layer of aluminum foil. This technique is called \"dum pukht,\" which means \"breathe and cook\" in Hindi; the idea is that the steam produced by the various aromatic liquids and from the marinade and the meat rises, further tenderizing the meat and rice, and then condenses, keeping everything in the pot from drying out. The classic method involves creating a seal by caking a simple dough around the cooking vessel’s lid, but the foil method (which is what I’ve shared here) suffices (and, admittedly, this is the method I use often). A thick layer of cloth wrapped around the mouth of the pot can also be used to create the seal. A heavy Dutch oven or saucepan with a heavy bottom with a heavy lid works great; however, a clay pot with a lid can also be used.      Biryani Garnishes             Nik Sharma     In this version, which might seem a bit restrained, I reserve some of the browned onions and add those as a garnish over the rice before I steam it, but you can do a lot more. Biryanis can be studded with various toppings, including quartered or halved hard boiled eggs, thick quarters of fried potatoes, or fried nuts such as cashews or almonds.    One final note on biryanis: take time to appreciate the reveal as the pot of rice is unwrapped. I find that first breath of the perfume emanating from the pot as it’s opened to reveal the colorful dish within to be the most exciting and magical part of the biryani experience.      How to Serve Biryani    I like to serve biryanis straight out of the pot because I enjoy using a spoon to reveal the cooked meat under the layer of rice. However, a biryani can be served on a large platter; just make sure not to overmix the rice before serving, since doing so obscures the variety of color the rice acquires during the cooking process. While the biryani can be served with plain unsweetened yogurt, my carrot raita would also be a wonderful accompaniment to this dish. I prefer to leave the whole spices in the cooked biryani, but if you like you can fish them out before serving.

This salad pays tribute to one of my all-time favorite Korean banchan, pa-muchim, a marinated scallion salad of raw shaved onions and scallions dressed with mustard, vinegar, gochugaru, and sesame oil. Pa-muchim is traditionally served as an accompaniment to samgyeopsal, or grilled pork belly; wrapped together in a lettuce leaf, pa-muchim’s acidity and underlying bitterness from mustard and raw onions balances the fat and smokiness from grilled pork.    This riff on pa-muchim uses Brussels sprouts leaves in place of scallions. The leaves are quickly charred in a hot cast iron pan to lightly wilt them and coax out their subtle bitterness. Once cooled, the Brussels leaves are tossed with thinly sliced raw leeks, which provide a heartier, longer-lasting crunch than sliced onions, and a coffee-Dijon dressing.    This dressing was a happy kitchen accident: I was making a batch of sesame mustard dressing and knocked my cup of morning coffee into the bowl, and I found that these two bold flavors worked beautifully together! With dueling bitterness, the Dijon acts as the soprano, while the coffee is the alto. They're balanced out by the addition of honey, cider vinegar, and nutty toasted sesame oil. To maximize the punch of the mustard, I recommend adding it to the vinaigrette right before dressing the salad, as it tends to lose some of its oomph if it sits in the dressing for an extended period of time.    When not used for this banchan, the coffee-Dijon is a dressing that should always be in your fridge; it works as a dipping sauce for fried chicken, it'll wake up sleepy Tuesday night roasted broccoli, and liven up a roasted pork loin with apples. The marinated charred Brussels sprouts and leeks can serve as a quick and easy everyday banchan for accompanying meat, poultry, and seafood dishes, but they'll also fit in nicely as part of a larger holiday meal.

Using ice water and a cold egg in the liquid portion of the batter further inhibits gluten development. Adding a savory fermented bean paste like doubanjiang, gochujang, or miso to the batter gives the pancakes a little personality. Frying the pancakes in an ample amount of oil over medium-high heat means the pancakes cook quickly and achieve a crisp exterior without overcooking, which can make the pancakes tough.    What do you do when your child refuses to eat vegetables? Make pancakes.    At least, that's been my solution since about October of 2019, when my now-three-year-old decided, seemingly overnight, that vegetables of any kind were poison.    From what I can tell, many, many parents have a similar challenge, and resort to all kinds of tricks to fool their kids: stuffing chopped up spinach into super-cheesy quesadillas, blending greens into sweet smoothies, etc. My child, however, has turned her nose up at those vegetable delivery systems, refused loaded scrambled eggs, and has even rejected a whole Neapolitan pizza because I, like a ding dong, thought a teaspoon of minced broccoli florets wouldn't be noticeable in the sea of oozy mozzarella and tart tomato sauce.    But since she seems perfectly happy eating the gyoza I make (not exactly this recipe; lighter on the pork, way heavier on the vegetables, which include Napa cabbage, carrot, the Japanese chives known as nira, and, if we have them, some chopped stir-fried pea shoot greens), I decided to try throwing those vegetables into a savory pancake. This was partly to get her to eat vegetables, but it was also partly to come up with a dish that I could throw together at a moment's notice, one that would both satisfy her dispiritingly exacting tastes and be palatable to me and my wife, thereby forgoing the need to make two entirely different dinners for a family of three.    While the idea was inspired by pajeon, savory Korean scallion pancakes, it quickly branched off into a different direction, mostly because I initially made a pancake batter with ingredients I had on-hand, and that was all-purpose flour cut with roasted chickpea flour. I added in some things that I thought would make the pancakes taste good in their own right—salt, of course, but also doubanjiang, the Sichuan spicy fermented broad-bean paste, and some minced garlic—then I added ingredients to achieve the specific batter consistency I thought would be best, one that yielded a fluffy, light pancake with crisp edges, yet also one that could stand up to being stuffed to the gills with a whole host of raw and cooked vegetables.      Ice Water Is Key    Over many months, I've tried this recipe using a variety of alternative flours—whole wheat, rice, roasted rice (typically used to make string hoppers, or idi appa), chickpea, roasted chickpea—and all of them work well, provided you adjust the amount of ice water used to make the batter. And that ice water is key: Between the low-gluten alternative flours and the ice water, provided the cook takes care to not overmix the batter, the result is a light, not heavy, crumb that has very little chew, an indication that the gluten within the flour mix hasn't been overdeveloped, which would make a tough, heavy, and chewy pancake.      Variations    I've come to appreciate how accommodating this recipe is. Aside from your choice of low-gluten alternative flour, you can also use whatever fermented bean paste you have on hand, whether it's miso, doenjang (Korean fermented bean paste commonly used in pajeon batter), or even gochujang, and you can use whatever raw, cooked, or fermented vegetables you have in your fridge. Chopped up kimchi works wonderfully in the batter (add in a few tablespoons of funky, fiery kimchi juice as well), as does stir-fried cabbage, or chopped up sautéed broccoli rabe. The one thing to keep in mind is that some raw vegetables, like cabbage and onions, have a fair amount of water in them, and you'll want to get rid of the excess somehow before folding the veg into the batter. In this recipe, I call for macerating the cabbage with salt as a low-effort way to do that, but you could just as easily cook the cabbage in a little bit of oil and achieve the same effect.    If you wanted to add in some kind of protein, leftover stir-fried meat works well, as does the inclusion of raw shrimp, chopped into smaller, quick-cooking pieces (this recipe can easily accommodate the addition of up to four ounces of chopped raw shrimp in addition to the vegetables listed).    The dipping sauce served alongside is entirely optional; it's mostly a holdover from thinking of these like gyoza pancakes. But the savory soy sauce combined with the brightness of rice vinegar and the earthiness of sesame oil gives the pancakes an extra dimension of flavor, and my child really loves dipping foods in sauces, but don't we all, in the end?", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Using a low-gluten flour like whole wheat, rice, or chickpea flour decreases the chances of overworking the dough, which can lead to tough pancakes.

In a nod to the popularity of gateau invisible in Japan, this version is subtly flavored with salty-sweet white miso, and served with a miso caramel sauce.Why It Works  Layering thinly sliced apples in a roughly uniform pattern produces clean, even slices of cake.White miso lends savory complexity to the cake and the caramel sauce.Slowly cooling the cake in the pan ensures that the pectin from the apples in the cake fully sets before serving.   Leave it to the French to invent a cake that evokes a sense of mystery. Gâteau invisible aux pommes, or \"invisible apple cake,\" features dozens of intersecting layers of thinly sliced apples bound in a sweet, custardy batter. Why invisible? When baked, the apples seem to disappear into the cake, and become texturally indistinguishable from the custard, forming a cohesive, sliceable dessert that’s decidedly more fruit than cake. (Apple a day? How about a whole cake’s worth of apples.) It’s often served with nuts and a caramel sauce. Think sweet apple gratin, but just a hair fancier.    Despite its French origins, gâteau invisible has found particular popularity in Japan. As a nod to that cultural-geographic pairing, I wanted to incorporate miso into this version of the dessert. While miso is known for being an ultra-salty, umami-packed condiment primarily used in savory dishes, it can also be a valuable component in sweet dishes. As bakers, we are taught to use salt to enhance the flavor of baked goods: Just a small pinch of salt brings complexity, reduces our perception of bitter flavors, and balances desserts that would otherwise be excessively sweet. Miso has these qualities in spades. When used judiciously, it lends nutty, caramel-like flavors that meld seamlessly with cold-weather flavors like butterscotch, pumpkin, and, of course, apple.    This cake begins with a loose batter of eggs and flour, along with a generous helping of white miso. Thinly sliced apples are folded into the batter, then loaded into a pan and baked. I tested different baking vessels, from large springform pans to square aluminum brownie pans, but found that a simple one-pound aluminum loaf pan produced the most impressive, uniform slices. As for assembly, I tried several methods ranging from simply dumping everything into the pan to meticulously arranging the apples in a seamless pattern. In the end, I found it important to arrange the apple slices such that their flat sides are flush with the edges of the pan, while filling the spaces between with a more random overlapping pattern. This method produced a cake with clean, straight sides and fewer irregularities.    Gâteau invisible is often served with a caramel sauce. For an off-beat riff on salted caramel, I whisk white miso into a scaled down variation of Stella’s Easy Caramel Sauce. In addition to its salt content, miso contributes nutty, fruity, and savory notes that give the caramel more depth of flavor. That one-two punch of miso both in the cake and the sauce yields a deeply satisfying dessert that’s great served at any temperature, any time of day.

Butter chicken is inherently delicious—even in its most streamlined and simplified form, it's tasty. But with just a little more effort, it becomes superlative. The goal of this recipe is to hit all the characteristic notes of butter chicken—mildly spiced tomato-based sauce; tender, charred chicken pieces; a mother’s love’s worth of butter and cream folded in at the end—while developing flavor at every turn. It may be a little more complicated than just placing all the ingredients in a pressure cooker and then blending them, like some other, very popular butter chicken recipes, but the extra effort is worth it.    Still, this recipe isn't difficult, despite the long ingredient list. The yogurt marinade for the chicken comes together in seconds, and while toasting and grinding whole spices improve their flavor and aroma considerably, you can use pre-ground spices for a small tradeoff in flavor. It may seem complicated to cook the chicken and sauce separately, but the reality is that it's dead easy, and the extra flavor you get from that char is absolutely worth it. For the sake of clarity, the recipe was broken up into two parts, but the chicken can be broiled as the sauce simmers, then set aside as you finish the sauce.    This is a stovetop adaptation of our pressure cooker butter chicken recipe, which you can refer to for the full recipe-testing notes. While this recipe takes about 40 minutes longer to prepare than the pressure cooker version, most of that time is hands-off, and the flavor is even better than the already-great pressure-cooked version.

The way I approach a menu. The way I stock my pantry. Even the basic ingredients I reach for first when I'm saying to myself, \"What would my wife want for dinner?\" (Which is just the nicer way of thinking, what would I personally really like to eat that my wife may or may not but hopefully may like to eat as well?)    The answer, more often than not, is chickpeas. And I'm not talking fancy, soaked overnight, simmered in flavorful liquid, carefully cooked chickpeas; I'm talking chickpeas drained out of a can and used as the base for a quick dish.    Now I can hear you bean lovers shouting already, \"But canned beans are flavorless! Dried beans rule!\" and I'm with you, but this is a case of diminishing returns. Provided you treat your canned beans right—that means spending a bit of time simmering them in a flavorful liquid (read up more on cooking with canned beans here), they can be tasty as heck and ready to eat in under half an hour. Will they be as creamy and flavorful as dried beans? Definitely not, but they'll be about 85 percent of the way there and take about 10 percent of the time and 5 percent of the effort.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    On most days, that's a pretty good trade-off.    Chickpeas—known as chana in Hindi—are a staple in Indian and British Indian vegetarian cuisine. It's meaty texture and flavor hold up well to rich sauces like masala or korma. This recipe, a chickpea stew flavored with coconut and thickened with ground cashews, comes from no particularly authentic Indian legacy, but it's delicious and rib-sticking. There are a few keys to success. The first is to cook the onion, garlic, and ginger base until you think it's too cooked—deep brown and on the verge of burning in spots. This adds sweetness and layers of intense flavor to the sauce.    The garam masala I use in this recipe is a homemade cumin and coriander-heavy mix (the flavors I like), but you can use your own blend or even a store-bought mix to make the recipe even quicker. In any case, toasting the spices in the oil will help intensify and distribute their flavor.    Once the base for the sauce is set, I deglaze with coconut milk, add toasted cashews, and grind the whole thing with plenty of fresh cilantro. A quick simmer for the chickpeas in the flavorful sauce, a big squeeze of lemon or lime at the end, and some warm homemade naan or rice, and dinner's on the table in under half an hour.", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Using canned chickpeas speeds the cooking process. Deeply browned onions, garlic, and ginger make a flavorful base for the curry."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/chickpea-coconut-and-cashew-curry-recipe"}

Eetch—pronounced midway between “itch” and “etch” and transliterated into English in just about all the ways you can imagine forming that sound—is a classic Armenian dish consisting of bulgur wheat, tomatoes, and lots of chopped green herbs. It’s often compared to tabbouleh, but unlike tabbouleh, it isn't really a salad, as it's more moist and cohesive. While it can be eaten with a fork, it's more often consumed wrapped with a tender lettuce leaf or a shroud of lavash.      What is Eetch?    It’s better to think of eetch as a meatless meat dish. Traditionally, Armenians were known for being pious and carnivorous in equal measure, and with some 160 fast days scattered throughout the Armenian Church calendar year (including the 40 days of Lent), they faced near-constant roadblocks to enjoying meat. Which means that Armenians have made vegetarian and vegan cooking something of an art form, and eetch is one of our greatest creations.    Eetch is actually a vegan version of kheyma, a finely-minced minced raw beef (or lamb) and bulgur meatball seasoned with tomato paste, lemon, dried chile pepper, lemon or pomegranate molasses, mild raw onion, and chopped fresh herbs. The mixture is kneaded with water until it becomes tacky and then formed into balls or logs, which are eaten wrapped in lettuce or lavash.    In eetch, the meat is left out. The meatiness and moisture of the dish is instead provided by additional tomato in various forms—paste, canned, and/or fresh—and the fat comes in the form of olive or vegetable oil. The onions are usually cooked rather than raw, which further serves to bolster the meatiness of the dish. And because the mixture lacks sticky meat proteins, it doesn’t get formed into balls; instead, it's spooned into the wrapper.      Eetch Variations    There are as many versions of eetch as there are Armenian families (more, even—there are at least three that circulate in mine). For my own version, which borrows heavily from several family recipes, I lean on tomato paste for the underlying meatiness and feature fresh tomatoes both in and on the dish. I like my eetch to be moist and yielding in texture, but not wet, making it imperative to avoid canned tomatoes in favor of fresh. The final consistency can be adjusted with water, but only as much as is needed.     Lemon is the most commonly used form of acid in eetch, though pomegranate molasses appears in some recipes. Since I like the caramel-fruitiness of pomegranate molasses and the tartness of lemon, I use both. Garlic is rarely used in eetch, but I like the way it amps up the meatiness, so I add a few minced cloves to the onions once they're fully softened.     Armenians adore herbs and herb salads. While some eetch recipes get just a sprinkling of chopped herbs, I tend to go all-in, using a hefty mixture of whatever tender aromatic herbs I have on hand: flat-leaf parsley, mint, cilantro, purple basil (Genovese basil is unknown in West Asian cuisine), or dill, along with scallions, which are pretty much mandatory. A portion of the chopped herb salad gets mixed into the eetch, and the remainder serves as a topping and garnish for the roll-ups.     About the bulgur: Eetch should have a smooth, almost silky consistency, which requires the use of fine bulgur to achieve. (Fine is also known as “#1” grade, with medium labeled as “#2” and coarse as “#3.\") Fine bulgur can be a challenge to find outside of Middle Eastern markets or online retailers; if unavailable, use the finest grade you can locate, and be sure to measure by weight and not volume to keep the total amount in line.     Eetch is usually served as part of an appetizer (meze) spread at gatherings, but it also makes a thoroughly satisfying and quick-to-assemble one-dish meal (which is how it most often appears in our house).

Quick-pickling the stone fruit adds complexity of flavor to the finished plate.   I often use this yogurt marinade at home, and it works equally well with boneless, skinless chicken breasts as it does with the boneless, skinless chicken thighs I call for here. Made from just a few ingredients, it’s quite aromatic and very flavorful, and offers a plethora of sensations, from the cool notes of mint to the warmer flavors provided by the garlic, ginger, chile pepper, and black peppercorns.    Part of why I like this preparation is its color and aroma, and I’ve found that the gentle cooking called for in this recipe helps to preserve the vibrant green of the marinade. While a little browning occurs on the edges of the pieces of chicken, browning and/or charring is not the goal. If you’d like to have your chicken browned a bit more, you can remove the chicken earlier than is called for and then slide the pieces under the broiler to finish cooking while developing a pronounced char, but I find this unnecessary.    You can take advantage of the gentle tenderizing effect of lactic acid in this marinade to plan ahead of time during a busy week. Combine the chicken with the marinade, divide it up into smaller portions in smaller ziptop bags or airtight, freezer-safe containers, and freeze the portions for up to 2 weeks. When ready to use, pull a bag out of the freezer, let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight, and then proceed with the recipe as written.    I like to serve the chicken with quick-pickled nectarines, which take just a few minutes to prepare, although they’re best if you allow them to sit in the spiced honey-and-vinegar mixture for about an hour before serving. Use ripe but firm nectarines; if the fruit is too soft, the combined action of the acid, honey, and salt will make the fruit fall apart quickly. (You can also use other fresh stone fruit, such as peaches or plums. For a stronger kick of heat, double the amount of chile pepper in the recipe.

Normally, I’m all about innovation and deep digging and hardcore testing here at The Food Lab. But this time I’m starting with a dish so iconic, so incredible, so damn-near-flawless in its original form that the best I can possibly hope to do is tweak it just a bit to suit my very particular personal tastes. I’m talking about the ricotta gnudi at The Spotted Pig, April Bloomfield’s West Village gastropub (which closed in January 2020). It was my favorite restaurant in New York, largely on account of those little buttery balls of dairy (though the perfect Sazeracs they made at both the upstairs and downstairs bars don’t hurt either).    I can still intimately remember the first time I had them. It was back in 2008 and I was on the home stretch of an eight-hour, 12-burger tour of New York. Despite the fact that I already had close to a dozen burgers in my belly, the bartender convinced me that the ricotta gnudi were worth a try. They came to the bar in a shallow dish, a half dozen pale yellow balls bathed in a creamy butter sauce with a dark streak of browned butter drizzled on top.    I could smell the nuttiness of the browned butter infused with crispy sage. What I didn’t expect as I picked up one of those gnudi was its texture. It felt almost like an under-inflated water balloon, a thin, thin skin that seemed impossibly delicate with a liquid center. I bit into it and felt the rush of warm savory sheep’s milk ricotta burst into my mouth. I quickly polished off the dish and ordered a second for my friends who were joining me later on.    I made it a point to stop into the ‘Pig and order a plate of those gnudi every time I visited New York, and I’m not the only one: they were the most popular dish on the menu for a reason.    The good news is that now that the Spotted Pig is closed, the gnudi are actually quite simple to make at home. All you’ve got to do is roll a ricotta mixture in semolina flour and let it rest overnight until that flour has hydrated and formed a thin, thin shell of pasta around the ricotta that just barely holds it together. Then you just boil and eat it. April herself offers up a recipe and technique in her book A Girl and Her Pig (required reading as far as I’m concerned). I’ve used her method in the past with excellent end results, but they can be a bit fiddly and require the use of a piping bag with a very large tip.    Over years of making these guys at home, I’ve come up with a few little tweaks and tips; minor modifications to the original technique that have maximized my own chance of success. Hopefully they’ll help you out as well. Here’s how I do it, step by step.      Step 1: Start With Good Ricotta and Drain It Well    As with my quick and easy ricotta gnocchi, I’ve found that the quality of the ricotta is of utmost importance to the success of this recipe. There’s really not much more to it. Not all ricotta is created equal. In fact, of commonly available supermarket ingredients, I’d say it’s the one product that shows the most variation between low and high quality. The good stuff can be heavenly, while the bad stuff? Gritty, watery, bland, sour-tasting dreck that’s not worth the cost of the plastic tub it comes packaged in.    Low-quality mass-market brands will have various gums and stabilizers listed as ingredients, included to bypass costly and time-consuming draining steps. You’re essentially buying water that’s been stabilized artificially to thicken up with the milk solids in the tub. Higher quality ricotta should list milk, salt, and, at the very most, either an acid or a natural culture. These are the only ones you should be buying. If you can find freshly made sheep’s milk ricotta at a specialty market or a farmer’s market, even better. It has a nice grassiness and sharp acidity that plays nicely with the rich butter sauce.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    To drain the ricotta, I use my patented rapid-drain technique: just spread the ricotta out on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel, and press it down with more clean towels. Lift off the towels (they should peel right off), and dump the ricotta into a bowl, leaving the excess moisture behind.      Step 2: Season and Mix             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Once the ricotta is drained, I weigh out exactly 12 ounces of it to which I add two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, along with a ton of black pepper. The gnudi at the ‘Pig have no pepper, but to me, ricotta without black pepper is like MacGyver without a pocket knife. It just doesn’t get the job done quite as well.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I fold all of this together with a rubber spatula.    At this point, in the original recipe, you’d transfer the soft mixture to a piping bag and pipe it out onto a bed of semolina flour in long logs that then get cut up with scissors into individual gnudi. I always found this process a little trying. Here’s what I do instead:      Step 3: Spread and Freeze    To get the mixture to firm up, I spread it out on a plate and transfer it to the freezer for about 15 minutes, just until it starts to harden. I then transfer it back to the bowl and work it with a spatula until no big chunks of frozen ricotta remain.      Step 4: Scoop and Coat             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    With the ricotta chilled and firm, it’s now pretty easy to portion it out with a small cookie scoop and dump the balls into a bowl of semolina flour. I use my fingers to scoop excess flour on top of the ricotta balls to coat them.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt      Step 5: Ball, Nest, Repeat             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Once the ricotta is coated on all sides with semolina, I pick it up and very gently roll it into a clean sphere in my fingertips, making sure not to fold it or to scrape off any of the semolina.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Next I give the ball a little nest inside a baking dish with another layer of semolina flour. The idea is that this baking dish is going to become the ricotta ball’s home for the next one to three days as a shell slowly forms around it.    Once all the ricotta balls are in place, I dump any remaining semolina over the top then cover the dish and let it rest in the fridge, turning the gnudi over a couple times a day as they rest. I find that about 18 hours is the minimum you need to form gnudi that have a thick enough shell not to completely burst as you cook them. Much longer than three days and the gnudi start to get dry inside as the pasta layer slowly absorbs interior moisture.              As soon as the gnudi feel relatively firm and dry to the tough, they’re ready to go.      Step 6: Make Sage Brown Butter    The saucing is entirely up to you. Even a good red sauce would be great with these, but I’m partial to the way April does it at the Spotted Pig. The duo of butter sauces really brings out the sweet, fresh dairy flavor of the gnudi.    Start by gently browning butter in a skillet.             J. Kenji López-Alt    Next add fresh sage leaves and fry them, turning, until they’re completely crisp. This will take a couple minutes. You will be hungry the entire time.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Transfer the fried sage leaves to a paper towel and immediately season them with salt. I eat two or three right off the bat. I just can’t help myself. I’m amazed that nobody has sold packages of fried sage leaves yet. I’d eat them as a snack.      Step 7: Boil the Gnudi    To cook the gnudi, I gently drop them into a large pot of boiling salted water. They are far more delicate than your average pasta, but not quite the tender, timid beasts that many folks make them out to be. I’ve never had any that have broken on me during cooking, though you do have to make sure to stir gently with a wooden spoon at the very start to ensure they aren’t sticking to the bottom of the pot. Just two to three minutes and they’re hot and ready. Rather than draining in a colander (which can cause the gnudi to crush each other), I use a slotted spoon to lift them out and transfer them to a skillet that’s already waiting for them with a few tablespoons of fresh butter.      Step 8: Make the Second Butter Sauce             J. Kenji López-Alt    The second sauce is just a simple emulsified butter sauce. At the Spotted Pig, you get a super luscious, creamy, perfectly emulsified beurre monté, which is relatively easy to make when you do it by the pound in a restaurant setting (or have the benefit of an industrial burner that will rapidly boil and emulsify butter and water), but tends to be a little more difficult to do at home in small batches. Never you fear, we’ll get there, and it’s much easier than you think once you learn to accept that you’re cheating just a little bit.    The key is to use plenty of pasta water. These gnudi shed semolina like a dog sheds hair in the summer, so your pasta water should be packed with it. When you combine some of this pasta water in a skillet with a few more tablespoons of butter, the starch granules from the flour swell up and burst, thickening the water and making it far easier to emulsify with the butter.    Just a vigorous boil on the stovetop with the gnudi already inside will transform your butter and pasta water into a creamy, gnudi-coating sauce.      Step 9: Plate Them Up!             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    And we’re done! All that’s left to do is plating, and that’s an easy one. Transfer the gnudi and whatever sauce clings to them from the pan to a serving platter, top with fried sage leaves, drizzle with browned butter, and you’re good to go. Just make sure your guests are ready and waiting because these gnudi are at their best just out of the kitchen and, as we all know, ricotta waits for no man.      Step 10: Open Wide             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt      Step 11: CHOMP             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Pro-tip: do NOT do what I did and bite off half of a gnudi. This is one of those cases where you wanna get the whole thing in your mouth in one go so that you can experience the pleasure of the dairy burst.    And there you’ve got it. My own take on my favorite dish in the world (made by one of my favorite chefs in the world), in your own kitchen. And it’s damned easy to boot. As Tom Petty says, it’s just the waiting that’s the hardest part.

Kilawin is a Filipino meat- and vinegar-based dish consisting of boiled and/or grilled meats, which can include goat, beef, pork, carabao (water buffalo), and deer or some combination thereof. It's characterized by layers of punchy, savory flavors and a range of textures, from crunchy and chewy to tender and soft. My version calls for dressing marinated and grilled pork belly, known as inihaw na liempo in Tagalog, in a tangy sauce made with red onion, garlic, and sukang Iloko, a dark-hued vinegar made from sugar cane molasses.    Traditionally, kilawin incorporates papaít, or bile from the gallbladder of a cow or goat, which lends an astringent note (I’ve left the papaít out in this recipe; the dish shines regardless). In certain regions, locals mix in tofu or offal like pork ears, tripe, liver, or heart to add another layer of flavor and other textures. The flavor profile of this dish―a combination of umami, sour, and bitter―is a true reflection of the Filipino palate.     Kilawin is often confused with kinilaw (raw fish marinated in vinegar) since the names are used somewhat interchangeably depending on the region. This likely stems from the fact that both rely on vinegar―a ubiquitous ingredient that was historically used to preserve food―to flavor (and cook, in the case of kinilaw) the protein.    To make my kilawin, I suggest you prepare the pork belly the morning of your meal or preferably the day before, as it involves soaking chunks of pork belly in a seasoned brine for anywhere from a minimum of 6 hours to a full 24 hours. Once the pork belly has been marinated, you cook it over hot coals before slicing it up into bite-size pieces. For the zesty dressing, all you have to do is whisk together sliced onion, minced garlic, vinegar, salt, sugar, and a copious amount of freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the pork and then serve it on its own or along with white rice and your favorite cold beer and watch it disappear.", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Brining the pork belly yields juicy and flavorful meat. The acidity of the vinegar-based dressing complements the crunchy, fatty grilled pork belly."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/kilawin-5195492"}

How many times have you seen someone post a photo or recipe of a delicious-looking dish online only to see responses like \"Hey! A mini burger is not a slider!\" or \"That stuff you made with the tiny bit of sugar added to it is not pizza sauce!\" or even \"If you aren't from [insert locality X], then you can't possibly understand much less make food from [locality X]!\"?    I mean, I get it. Food instills passion. Food has history. Food is culture. It should be taken seriously and respectfully. But at the same time, it's meant to be delicious and give pleasure. If someone wants to shove some lobster in a tiny roll, serve it to their friends and family and call it a slider, who am I to tell them otherwise?    That's the logic I'm going to be using today while examining and fully bastardizing what undoubtedly ranks as one of the top 10 most prescriptivist dishes around: cassoulet. What started in the region of Languedoc as a humble peasant dish of dried beans cooked with various sausages and preserved meats—think of it as Southern French Beanee-Weenees—has turned into an all-out culture war with not one, not two, but three towns all claiming to be the originators of the One True Cassoulet.    You thought local sports fans are insane? You should head over to one of those medieval walled cities—Toulouse, Castelnaudary, and Carcassonne all have claims to the dish—and chat with some local cassoulet chefs to see what a true fanatic is like. The comparison is not as crazy as it sounds—members of the Académie Universelle du Cassoulet wear brightly colored uniforms, hand out medals, and wave banners just like sports fans. (I didn't spot any cassoulet cheerleaders twirling confit goose legs along the walls of Carcassonne when I visited a couple years ago, but I wouldn't be surprised if they exist.)    Toulouse chefs insist on mutton, those in Castelnaudary proclaim duck confit and pork make the superior cassoulet, while Carcassonne residents prefer goose and partridge.    Here's the truth of the matter: Cassoulet is not cheffy, prescriptivist stuff. It's a medieval peasant dish designed to make do with whatever was around. In Languedoc, that happened to be dried beans, preserved duck, and preserved pork.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt      Classic Cassoulet    The first time I had cassoulet in its home turf (the Carcassonne version, in fact) it was a revelation: The cassoulet I'd known for nearly all of my professional career is nothing like the cassoulet found in Languedoc. It's as if I'd spent my life in the kitchen at Giordano's in Chicago and just found out that there's a style of pizza beyond deep dish and that not only that, but I'm the weird one here. That loose, almost soup-like stew of beans and meat was so far removed from all versions of cassoulet I'd had in the United States, or even in other parts of France. Gone was the stodgy, stew-like broth. Gone were the bread crumb toppings. Gone were the extra vegetables.    Instead, we were presented with a large, bubbling vat of beans and meat, covered in a crust so dark that it was almost black. Our hostess cracked open the crust to reveal beans swimming in a rich, gelatinous broth with bits of tender duck leg, cured pork belly, pork shanks, and a few different sausages.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Just as in a good risotto, the cassoulet flowed slowly across the plate, spreading out into a loose sauce. None of that solid-enough-to-mound stuff I'd seen everywhere else. Flavorwise, it was different too. Rich, meaty, and overwhelmingly simple, there were a few background notes from aromatic vegetables—onions, carrots, celery, a few cloves, perhaps some bay leaf and parsley—but the main flavor was just that of the cured meat, a good stock, and beans.    Like I said: simple, peasant fare.    The beans were cooked to the point of maximum creaminess—like a good loose hamburger, they were held together with nothing more than hope, melting on your tongue as soon as they hit your mouth. Similarly, all of the meats were meltingly tender, to the point where the only real texture was from the crust.    The thing is, I thought I knew what cassoulet was before trying it in Languedoc. I made it at fancy pants restaurants. I'd eaten it everywhere from New York to Paris. I'd bought it in ridiculously expensive imported jars. I spent months developing a recipe for Cook's Illustrated that never saw the light of day (people just don't feel like confit-ing their own duck).    But none of them ever came close to the real thing. Too thick, too fussy, too breadcrumb-y.    The version I'm giving you today does. And like any good peasant fare, it requires very little technique or skill, but does require a bit of time and TLC.    So how does one take this simple country dish and bring it home? Come along and I'll show you.      Using Chicken to Make Traditional Cassoulet    I need to get one thing off my chest right away: I am not using duck or goose confit in my cassoulet. I am using plain old chicken legs. Not a true cassoulet without confit, you say? To you I say: \"Whoa whoa whoa—back off man. I'm a graduate of the Académie Universelle du Cassoulet, and I have the paperwork to prove it.\"             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I started tackling this recipe with the thought that I'd use confit—I even developed a recipe for making confit yourself from scratch. Then it struck me: I'm spending days making what is meant to be a simple peasant dish, and not only that, but by doing so, the end result is actually less true to the original. How so?    Well, duck is an ingredient in traditional cassoulet not by choice, but by necessity. Back in the days before refrigeration, duck meat was preserved by heavily salting it, slow-cooking it, then packing it under a layer of its own fat. Now sure, it turns out that this produces a fantastically tasty end product, but it's by no means a requisite for cassoulet. I'd argue that the most important part of the confit process—the slow cooking to tenderize tough connective tissue—is entirely wasted in a dish like cassoulet where the meat ends up getting slow-cooked anyway.    In fact, when tasted side-by-side, a confit duck leg slow-cooked in a cassoulet compared to a fresh duck leg cooked in the same pot comes out much drier and stringier, a consequence of its double cooking. I'll just say it: Fresh duck is better for cassoulet than confit duck.    So why chicken? Well, duck happens to be very common and inexpensive in medieval Southern France. In modern urban America, not so much. You could go out and buy duck legs to use for this recipe, but chicken is cheap, widely available, and easy to work with. And you want to know something else? With so much flavor packed into the cooking liquid—sausages, salted pork, cloves—you actually don't miss the duckiness of the traditional dish.    Here's another thing: Most of the distinguishing flavor in a particular type of meat comes from the fat. Cook a beef steak in lamb fat and it'll taste like a lamb chop. Seriously.    So instead of just using duck, what if I were to incorporate a bit of store-bought duck fat?             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I used that duck fat to brown my meat and bingo: true ducky, cassoulet flavor without any need for actual duck. I'd offer a totally insignificant cash reward for anyone who submits themselves to a Pepsi challenge and blind-tastes a bit of slow-cooked chicken and slow-cooked duck from the same pot of cassoulet prepared with duck fat and can tell me which is which.    Even without the duck fat, a chicken-based cassoulet is killer, so don't sweat it if you can't find or don't want to shell out for duck fat.      Two Porks Make a Flavor-Packed Cassoulet    After the poultry, the pork is the next most important flavoring element in the cassoulet (I decided to not even bother trying to seek out mutton shoulder). Sausages are a must. In Languedoc, you'd typically find a garlicky pork sausage flavored with a bit of red wine. Back here, I like to use whatever mild garlic sausage I can find, though if you want to play Cassoulet Choose Your Own Adventure, you can go with any flavor sausage in the shop. Hot Italian? Chorizo? Go for it. I promise you nobody at the table will turn down your food.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    For the cured, fatty element, I tried various cuts including salted pork belly, regular bacon, pancetta, salted fatback, and salted smoked ham hocks. Both the bacon and hocks imparted too much smoky flavor to the mix. Fatback was just too fatty, and pancetta was immediately identifiable. Salted pork belly (usually sold as \"salt pork\" in the meat or sausage case) was the way to go.    I decided to start my cassoulet by rendering the fat from the pork belly and using it to brown the rest of my ingredients.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Browning it as a whole piece before slicing it into smaller chunks for slow cooking seemed like a good way to go about it, but in the interest of saving time and streamlining, I settled on cutting it into chunks before browning. This gave more surface area for rendering fat to escape, as well as more surface for browning, which led to deeper flavor in the finished dish.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I tried various sizes from thin strips to little quarter-inch lardons and found that I much preferred larger, meatier chunks. Pieces about three-quarter-inch square are perfect.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Rendering them slowly helps them release maximum fat without burning around the edges. Once the meat is golden brown and has rendered most of its fat, I take it back out of the pot.      How to Brown Chicken for Cassoulet    One thing I learned the hard way: You don’t need to salt your chicken. There's already a ton of salt that makes it into the dish from the salt pork and other ingredients, not to mention the liquid that slowly reduces in the oven.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Salting your chicken separately makes for an inedibly salty dish. Just a few solid grinds of pepper are all it takes before the chicken is ready to go for a swim in the hot rendered pork fat.    One of the biggest mistakes I used to make as a young cook-ling was getting impatient with my browning.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Ok—the first big mistake I made was fearing the fat. I'd drop pieces of chicken or steak into the pan from afar, thinking that I'd save myself a few burns. Instead, all I did was splash hot oil onto my body. When adding food to hot fat, lower it in gently, letting your hand get down right to the surface.    After that, let the chicken do its thing. You know how you think that by walking into the bedroom every few minutes to check on her progress you can get your wife to put those clothes on her body faster for that dinner you're already late to but really you just make her go even slower? Chicken is the same way. Except it's a pot instead of a bedroom, it's browning instead of getting dressed, and it's a cold lifeless shell of what was once a living, breathing creature instead of... Ok. That bit’s the same.*    *Just kidding Adri, I love you and your warm soul.    Point is: don't poke and prod that chicken too much, and definitely don't flip it until it is deeply, deeply browned. All that flavor is going to go right into your beans. Take out the chicken after browning both sides and set it aside with the pork belly.    Once the chicken is done, it's time to brown the sausage.    Can you see where we're going with this? Building up layers of browned flavors.      Preparing Beans and Aromatics for Cassoulet    Now comes a deeper question: how to incorporate the aromatics. Some recipes I've seen call for onions, carrots, celery, and garlic to all be finely chopped and left in the finished dish. I personally find the little bits of vegetables very distracting.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Instead, I chop only the onion and add it to the pot after the meat is done browning, using the steam and moisture it gives off to deglaze the pan, scraping up all the flavorful browned bits that the meat left behind. As for the other aromatics—a carrot, a couple stalks of celery, a head of garlic, some sprigs of parsley, a couple bay leaves, and few cloves—I find leaving them in large chunks and using them to flavor the stock that I cook the beans in is the best way to extract subtle flavor without the distracting bits of vegetable in the finished dish.    As for those beans, I tested my recipes using a few different types of dried white beans from actual lingot I brought back from Languedoc to cannellini to small navy beans. Cannellini were the best domestic option. I tried cooking them a number of ways, from canned (no good—they don't develop flavor the way I'd like them to and the liquid doesn't thicken up enough as they cook) to non-soaked to soaked-and-cooked to completely pre-cooked before adding to the rest of the ingredients.    The best method was somewhere in between. I start by soaking my beans in a salty brine. (Despite what you may have heard about salt preventing beans from softening properly, it actually accomplishes the exact opposite goal: salt ensures that bean skins turn tender.)    Bean skins are held together by pectin, a sort of organic glue. Buttressing this pectin are magnesium and calcium ions. It takes a lot of work to take these down. But in the course of an overnight soak, some of those magnesium and calcium ions will get replaced by sodium ions. These guys are sort of like the double agents of the ion world. The beans will seem firm at first, but as soon as you start cooking them, those sodium ions reveal that they are not nearly as good at keeping pectin strong as the magnesium or calcium. Your bean skins will soften in record time and cook more evenly in the process.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    After draining the soaked beans I add them to the pot with the onions along with a quart of store-bought chicken stock and the aromatics. I simmer them until just shy of cooked before fishing out the spent aromatics, adding the meats back in, mixing everything around, and throwing it all into a low oven to finish cooking.      How to Get a Delicious Crust on Your Cassoulet             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    This is where the real magic of cassoulet happens. See, a good stock should be rich with proteins, and just like the proteins in meat, they brown when heated. As you cook a cassoulet in the oven, the top layer of liquid slowly evaporates, leaving an ever more concentrated layer of proteins on its surface. Eventually, these proteins form a raft-like skin.    By occasionally removing the cassoulet from the oven and breaking that skin, allowing fresh liquid to flow above it (traditionalists will tell you that seven times is the optimal number of breaks for the best skin), you build up a significant layer of skin. It's this skin that browns, forming the crust of a traditional cassoulet.    It's these proteins that transform this:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Into this:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    At least, that's what's supposed to happen.    The sad reality is that most of the cassoulets I've cooked in the past have ended up looking like this:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    A slight indication of skin at the top, but really it looks more like a bug than a feature.    What's the problem?    First off, it's the shape of the pan. A traditional cassole has a tapered shape that gives it an extremely high surface area to volume ratio. More room for evaporation means better skin formation and better browning. In fact, the last two pictures above are of cassoulets cooked in the exact same manner, the only difference being the vessel they are cooked in.    Unfortunately, it's tough to find a good cassoulet pot around here.    A regular cassoulet will form a crust in about four hours of cooking in a 300°F (150°C) oven. What about if you just cook your Dutch oven cassoulet for longer or hotter? I tried a variety of time and temperature ranges. At the very best, what you end up with is this:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Decent crust alright, but the crust is really formed by the beans and the meat, not by the liquid itself. Underneath, the beans are too dry.    The second problem is the store-bought stock I'd been using. Homemade chicken stock tends to be very high in gelatin, a result of the high amount of connective tissue in the bones and cartilage used to make it. Store-bought stock, by contrast, is thin and watery. It's this gelatin that forms the crusty raft on top of the cassoulet, giving it both crust and body.    It's these two problems—wrong pot, not enough gelatin in the stock—that lead many recipes to resort to using breadcrumbs to create an artificial crust.    So what's the solution? Well the obvious one is to just make your own stock. It's actually way easier than it sounds, though it again requires a bit of a time commitment. I'll admit it: Sometimes even I'm too lazy to make my own stock when I've already got a day-long project ahead of me.    So what's the next best thing?    Just fake it.    By blooming store-bought unflavored gelatin in regular store-bought stock, you can create a rich stock full of body that forms a raft just like the real deal. I don't go easy on the gelatin either (remember, you have to make up for using the wrong-shaped pot as well). A full three packets for a quart of liquid gives it the body and crust I'm looking for.    In order to get a cassoulet that stays nice and loose underneath while still building a crust up top, it's important not to drown that crust out. If your liquid level starts to get too low, add more liquid (just plain water works) to the pot by carefully pouring it along the side of the pot so that it goes under the crust, not over it.    Now there's a cassoulet worthy of rooting for, funny little suits, medieval cheerleaders and all.    Break into that crust, and here's what you've got underneath:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Creamy, flavor-packed beans with meltingly tender nubs of pork belly and sausage and chicken legs that fall off the bone in moist shreds, all in a rich, sticky liquid that drinks like liquid pork.    This is the kind of fare that demands you sit down and make an event out of, good Languedoc wine and all.    It's the kind of meal so rich and hearty that all you could possibly eat on the side is a simple green salad (preferably with an excellent French vinaigrette).    I mean, just look at it:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    LOOK AT IT:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    ALL OF THIS CAN BE YOURS.    And it's way easier than it seems. But isn't deceptively simple, delicious food what good country eating is all about, chickens and all?

As someone who consciously goes vegan for a month out of every year, and who maintains a mostly vegetable- and grain-based diet throughout the rest of the year, I've given more than a little thought to vegan recipes, with ideas for everything from breakfast to soup, salads to main courses, and sandwiches to junk food (I can tell you that you've never tasted vegan nachos complete with gooey cheese sauce or mushroom-based B.L.T. sandwiches like these!).    But there's one thing I haven't tackled, and that's the holiday roast. When Thanksgiving and Christmas roll around, it seems like every magazine and food website (including ours!) is all about turkey, roast beef, and ham. Oh, well why don't you fill up on these side dishes? is the general response you'll get as a vegan at an omnivore holiday spread, never mind the fact that most holiday side dishes aren't even vegan to begin with.*    *See if you can convince your family to put this vegan stuffing on the table this year. It kicks some serious butt.    Coming up with a vegan holiday roast is a daunting task! It can't just take the place of the turkey or the prime rib nutritionally, it's got to cover all of those mental bases as well. Not only does it have to taste spectacular, but it's got to look stunning at the center of the table, with rich, deep flavors that scream fall and winter. And I'm sorry to you faux meat lovers, but a Tofurky just don't cut it.              My goal was to come up with a recipe for a vegan roast that is so pretty, so mouth-watering, so packed with flavor and texture that even the hardcore carnivores at the table will want to make room on their plate for a slice, perhaps even instead of that turkey.              It's been a few years in the making and I've had to synthesize techniques cribbed from many of my past vegan recipe experiments, but this year I finally got there. It starts with a central layer of stuffing made with cashews braised in vegetable stock, along with sautéed shiitakes and leeks, garlic, herbs, toasted sunflower seeds and pepitas, and semi-dehydrated white beans. The next layer is roasted carrots bound together with some mushroom duxelles made with fresh creminis, shallots, maple-smoked portobello mushroom crumbles, and just a few breadcrumbs. Finally, a second layer of cashew-bean mixture goes around the outside before it's all wrapped in layers and layers of crispy phyllo dough, brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with coarse sea salt, and baked. I serve it all with a vegan gravy.    I'm not sure what to call this roast quite yet. Perhaps Vegetables Wellington? Does that sound good? Let's go with Vegetables Wellington.    A word of warning: this recipe is a big project. This is quite possibly the most involved recipe I've ever written. It's an all-day recipe that you'll want to grab a couple friends to help out. You'll roast, you'll sauté, you'll simmer, you'll braise, you'll dehydrate, you'll smoke, you'll layer, you'll assemble—you'll use basically every cooking technique I can think of. If you're the kind of person who's content with grabbing a Tofurky and throwing it in the oven, this is not the recipe for you. If you enjoy eating but not cooking, this is not the recipe for you. But if you, like me, love getting your hands dirty, if you find pleasure in seeking out good ingredients and handling them with care, and if picking herbs on a Saturday afternoon is your idea of a good time, then, my friends, come with me; we've got some serious cooking to do.      Initial Inspirations: Carrots Wellington From Narcissa    The basic inspiration for this recipe came from the phenomenal \"Carrots Wellington\" that Chef John Fraser serves at his Manhattan Restaurant, Narcissa, on the Lower East Side. His vegetarian dish is made with roasted carrots layered with walnuts and sunchokes, all wrapped in buttery puff pastry and served with sautéed bluefoot mushrooms. It's a clever play on a traditional Beef Wellington, and at least to my palate, is actually more interesting and exciting than the meaty original.              In his version, carrots compose the bulk of the interior. In ours, they're just one element, but we'll still treat them with care.    In my article on Roasting Fall Vegetables, I talk about how the trick with carrots is getting them nice and caramelized without letting them lose too much moisture. The key is to start them in water, then finish them in the oven.              You can actually do this all in a single pan. I put my carrots into a skillet, cover them with salted water, then bring it to a hard boil and let them cook down until tender. At this stage, most likely the water will have all evaporated. If not, I just pour off the excess.    Next, I drizzle them with a bit of oil, add a couple sprigs of herbs, and toss them into a hot oven to roast. As they roast they'll intensify in flavor. Then, while that's all going on, I turn to my mushroom layer.      Umami Bomb #1: Mushrooms and Soy    To bind the carrots, I wanted to go with an element that would not only hearken back to the original concept of Beef Wellington—beef tenderloin wrapped in a layer of mushroom duxelles—but would also bring something intensely savory and umami to the mix, an element often missing from vegan recipes.    I started off by making a pretty classic duxelles base by sautéing chopped cremini mushrooms with olive oil and shallots until nicely browned. A small shot of soy sauce gave them a more intense savoriness, while a splash of bourbon livened them up and seemed holiday-appropriate (especially as I took a little splash for myself).    While a classic duxelles would get bound with cream, I knew I'd need something a little more substantial (and more to the point, plant-based) than that. Japanese-style breadcrumbs did the trick.              Now I just needed some aromatics to bump up flavor. Although sage, rosemary, thyme, and parsley might be more classic Thanksgiving flavors, I decided to take this one in a slightly different direction, instead opting to use fines herbes—a mix of parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil. (You can honestly use whatever herb mix you'd like.)      Umami Bomb #2: Mushrooms and Smoke    The mushroom duxelles was pretty darn tasty on its own, but this roast is not meant to be just darn tasty, it's meant to be a complete showstopper, and that meant at least doubling up on umami mushroom flavor. For the second type of mushroom I used a technique I developed last year for making mushroom bacon.    First, I thinly sliced portobello mushrooms (any kind of mushrooms work, actually), tossed them with some olive oil, and laid them out in a single layer on a baking sheet. After roasting them until almost fully dehydrated and crisped, I smoked them.    It's actually pretty easy to smoke things yourself indoors without any particularly special tools. The easiest tool-free method is to place a wood chunk directly over the flame of a gas burner until it smolders. Drop it into a heavy pot, place your food-to-be-smoked in a wire mesh strainer on top, then seal it all up with aluminum foil for 10 to 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can place wood chips or sawdust in the bottom of a pot or wok, set it over a burner, and heat until it starts smoldering before adding the food-filled strainer and the foil.              If you, like me, have yourself a kitchen torch, then it's even easier. Just add your chips or wood chunks to the bottom of a heat-proof bowl or pot and light 'em up with a torch...              ...then place your mushroom chips in a strainer above and cover it up with foil.              For my standard mushroom bacon recipe, I toss the mushrooms with salt, sugar, garlic, paprika, and black pepper. Here, I replaced the sugar with maple syrup for a more intense, Thanksgiving-themed flavor.    Be careful, these things are incredibly delicious and absorbing and you may find yourself eating the whole batch before you get a chance to finish the recipe. Greater (wo)men have fallen into lesser traps.              Finally, I chop it all up into mushroom bacon bits and fold it into the duxelles.      Bring the Soup to the Nuts: Braising Cashews    From other testing, way back when I developed these Vegan Burgers that Don't Suck, I knew that cashews are a great way to bring texture and flavor to a vegan mix like this. But I wanted to improve their texture this go-round, using a technique that I first tasted as part of a vegan tasting menu at Del Posto. There, Chef Mark Ladner cooks raw dried nuts as if they're beans, simmering them for a long time. You end up with a texture that becomes juicy and tender, while still retaining a unique crunch that you don't get with beans.              Instead of the plain salted water Ladner uses, I went with a batch of my Hearty Vegetable Stock.    The cashews were coming out okay time after time, but it wasn't until I accidentally left them on the stovetop for a little too long that I discovered the secret: Instead of cooking the nuts until tender and straining them, what if I were to let them cook until that stock is reduced down to almost nothing?              I tried it and the flavor is simply incredible. As the stock slowly reduces, it intensifies in flavor. That flavor works itself into the nuts and eventually ends up as an intense glaze that coats each one. It's really incredible how delicious they are.    I transferred them to the food processor for a couple of quick pulses.              A rough-chopped texture should be easy to incorporate into my final mix.      Bean Steam: Why Roasting Works    Let's move on to the beans. Typically I recommend cooking dried beans in stock to get the best flavor out of them, but this time I decided to employ a method I developed when working on my Really Awesome Black Bean Burgers. (Yes, that's what I called them. You heard me.)              I start with canned beans (in this case cannellini), drain them, and spread them out on a sheet tray before setting them in a 350°F oven to roast.    The big problem with bean-based burgers and roasts is that in their normal, fully-cooked state, beans are far too wet and mushy. You end up with a squishy, textureless roast. Dehydrating fully cooked beans by roasting them in the oven solves that problem, giving them a more intense flavor and a nice, meaty texture.*    *For the record, cooking dried beans half way does not accomplish the same goal. Dried beans don't tenderize until fully cooked, so to get similar results, you'd need to fully cook the beans first, then partially dehydrate them.    As the beans roast, I sauté a mix of leeks, celery, shiitake mushrooms, and garlic.    It all gets pulsed together in the food processor, and then added to the bowl with the chopped braised cashews.    For a final hit of texture, I briefly pulse toasted sunflower seeds and pepitas.              The resulting mix ain't the prettiest thing in the world as-is, but darned if it ain't tasty.    With the two fillings constructed and the carrots roasted, it's time to put it all together.      Constructing the Vegetables Wellington    In my standard Beef Wellington recipe, I use sheets of phyllo dough as a means of keeping various layers of filling tightly bound before wrapping the whole thing up in puff pastry.    Some commercial store-bought puff pastry is made with shortening and fake butter flavoring. While technically vegan, that fake butter flavor is so unappealing to me that I'd rather go with a different option. Simply using more phyllo is the way to go.    Start by laying out a single sheet of store-bought phyllo (keep the rest under plastic wrap to make sure it doesn't dry out) and brushing it with olive oil. Place a 2-inch line of the bean/cashew mixture along one edge, giving it a border all around. If you want to be very ambitious at this stage, you can replace this center layer with some of my vegan stuffing.    Next, roll up the filling into the single sheet of phyllo like a burrito, folding in the sides about halfway through rolling.    You should end up with a long, slender cigar-shaped package. Set it aside for now.    For the next phase, you want a triple layer of phyllo, with a bit of olive oil brushed in between each sheet. (I tried it with just one layer and the phyllo fell apart as I was rolling.)    Once the phyllo is laid out, spread half of the mushroom mixture evenly along the bottom two-thirds of it, leaving a border all around. Then, lay the carrots on top in even rows. Spread the remaining mushroom mixture on top of the carrots with your hands, pressing down to make sure it all forms an even, hole-free layer.    Carefully roll the whole thing up. This time, don't bother tucking in the sides, just let them hang out over the ends. We'll deal with them later.              For the final layer, you're going to need to spread the remaining cashew/bean filling into a thin, even layer that covers almost the entire surface of a sheet of phyllo. This is very, very difficult to do by hand without tearing the phyllo. Instead, I use this method.    Start by spreading the filling onto a sheet of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet.              Place a second sheet of parchment on top and smooth it out to remove any air bubbles between it and the filling.    Next place another tray on top and press down firmly on it with your hands. You'll end up using most of your body weight if you weigh about the same as I do. Slowly work the filling out, pressing on the pan in several locations to squeeze it into a thin, even layer.              When all's said and done, you should be able to lift the top pan and the top sheet of parchment to reveal something that looks like this. From here, we just construct upside down.    Lay the first sheet of phyllo dough on top of the stuffing, then brush it with olive oil and layer on the second. Continue layering the phyllo this way until you've added another 6 layers or so.    To get the thing right-way-up again, place another sheet of parchment on top, sandwich it all between two trays and invert it.    Finally, peel off what is now the top layer of parchment, and you've got yourself a stack of phyllo sheets topped with a thin, even layer of the cashew/bean stuffing.              Place the carrot and mushroom-packed roll on top, then roll it all up into a single large cylinder. Finish it off by laying out a sheet of phyllo, brushing it with olive oil, and rolling the cylinder up in it. Repeat until all the remaining phyllo sheets have been used.    Place the rolled Wellington on a sheet of parchment, brush it with more olive oil, sprinkle it with coarse sea salt, then slash the top gently with a sharp knife.              Transfer it to a hot oven and bake until the phyllo is puffed, crisp, and golden brown. Remove it from the oven and stare at your creation with joy and admiration.    Those loose ends of phyllo can now be easily trimmed with a sharp serrated bread knife to give the roast a table-ready presentation (and to give you a snack to crunch on while the rest of the family makes its way to the dinner table).              There now, isn't that...Oh shoot! Almost forgot about the gravy! Thanksgiving ain't Thanksgiving without gravy, am I right?      The All-Important Sauce: How to Make a Vegan Gravy    The gravy I use here is pretty darn simple. All it is is my Hearty Vegetable Stock whisked into a roux made with flour and olive oil. I season it heavily with plenty of black pepper and a little extra shot of soy sauce for good measure.              There now. If you can honestly tell me that this isn't a gorgeous slice of food, I'll go back into the kitchen and replace it with a pound of rolled up bacon. But be honest here, okay?    It's got incredibly rich, complex flavor with the roasted carrots; the sautéed, smoked, and crisped mushrooms; the cashews braised in reduced stock; not to mention all of the herbs and aromatics (and bourbon). The texture combines firm, meaty elements (the roasted carrots and the dehydrated beans), crisp elements (the phyllo crust and the seeds), and moist, crunchy elements (the braised cashews and all the mushrooms). Juice it all up with a heavy-handed pour of gravy and there's really not much more you could ask for in a single dish.              Michael Ruhlman once wrote an essay about the dumbing down of recipes, describing how every recipe these days promises superlative results with barely any effort, very little time, and even less practice or skill. This is not one of those recipes.    Like I said: this is a difficult, time consuming recipe that calls for several different cooking methods and techniques, along with a bit of finesse to put it all together. It'll probably take some practice. I can promise you superlative results, but I also make no apologies for what it'll take to get you there. I wish you all good luck, good eating, and (if you happen to be vegan), a wonderful, plant-based Thanksgiving.    Nobody ever became a vegan because it's easy, but damn, can it be rewarding!", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Combining three different mushroom preparations with roasted carrots, dehydrated beans, braised cashews, nuts, and aromatics creates an intense interplay of textures and flavors.Phyllo pastry brushed with olive oil holds everything together, making for a stunning centerpiece."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/vegetables-wellington-the-ultimate-plant-based-vegan-holiday-roast-recipe"}

We all know what to expect each year at Thanksgiving. There are logistical headaches, including the annual game of fridge-space Jenga and the monumental task of trying to serve a lot of hot food to a lot of people, all at the same time. As for the food itself, there will be stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, the turkey, pie, and the inevitable appearance of that “signature side” some twice-removed cousin always brings, even though you diplomatically twice-reminded them that they really didn’t need to go to the trouble this year.    One thing that can’t be counted on for Thanksgiving dinner—a vegetarian centerpiece. Most vegetarians are experienced at cobbling together a holiday meal of side dishes, which isn’t awful, but it often means forgoing the best items on the menu (stuffing, a gravy moat for mashed potatoes, the iconic turkey). Dinner can end up feeling like an afterthought.    Attempts at inclusivity in the form of tofurkey are a lot like your uncle’s conversational use of “lit” and “AF”—well intentioned but painfully out of touch. To be fair, pulling off a vegetarian alternative to a large roast of meat is no simple task.    For one, there aren't many vegetables that have the scale to be presentation-piece-worthy on their own. And, while whole roasted heads of cauliflower are definitely having a moment, they aren't exactly holiday comfort food. Forcing a like-for-like vegetable-as-meat parallel isn't the answer.    Instead, we can embrace the sides-as-main-course angle and just put a bit more thought into it to come up with a cohesive and satisfying dish. By using ingredients that most people already have on hand for Thanksgiving dinner, I was able to come up with a well-considered vegetarian main course that's not only a complete thought but also a dinner-table stunner. Behold: the stuffed roast pumpkin.      Stuffed Pumpkin Variations    Stuffed pumpkins are one of the few made-for-Pinterest foods that are as tasty as they are adorable. They're classic cold-weather comfort food, a genre that the French have on lock (cassoulet, anyone?).    In France, this dish is commonly made using a squash varietal called potimarron, which gets its name from a combination of the French terms for \"pumpkin\" (potiron) and \"chestnut\" (marron). This squash is known as red kuri here in the States, borrowing the Japanese word for \"chestnut\" (kuri).    As these names suggest, kuri squash takes on a rich, nutty flavor when roasted. Potimarron farci (stuffed kuri squash) can be filled with any number of ingredients, beginning with a hearty base like lentils, rice, or grains. My favorite version uses pieces of dried bread as a foundation, saturating them in cream, cheese, and herbs to make a savory bread pudding, in a pumpkin. Traditional recipes load up the hollow gourd with salty pork parts, but to make this vegetarian, I obviously left those out.    My mission was to create a vegetarian stuffed pumpkin that felt even more at home on the Thanksgiving table. I wanted to create a main course that delivered all those classic autumnal flavors, while also providing the visual wow factor of a holiday roast.    I started by using sugar pumpkins instead of red kuri squash, since they're more widely available in the United States (plus, they deliver a true jack-o'-lantern look), but then added a kabocha squash purée to the filling, which introduces a nutty flavor similar to that of the red kuri squash.    I also replaced the salty pork with sautéed shiitake mushrooms and lacinato kale, sprinkling in toasted pepitas and pecans for a nutty crunch. A generous amount of warm-spiced heavy cream and Gruyère cheese should lay to rest any concerns that going vegetarian has to mean compromising richness.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    All of these components get layered into the pumpkins, which I paint with a salty-sweet miso-honey glaze before roasting. Yup, you can eat the whole thing, skin and all. I’m not always one for foods acting as cooking or serving vessels (big fan of the We Want Plates subreddit right here), but this is no chowder in a sourdough-bread bowl; this is a Thanksgiving stuffed pumpkin to make the turkey-eaters jealous.      Bake What Your Menu Gave You    Before we embark on this roasted-pumpkin journey together, I want to make clear that this recipe is not meant to be rigidly prescriptive. Like cassoulet, this dish has humble roots, and, as Kenji pointed out in his treatise on French stewed beans and meats, it’s the kind of recipe that is designed to make do with what is available.    For our purposes, that means filling your pumpkins with whatever you've already got for the rest of your Thanksgiving menu. This is a stressful enough meal to execute as it is, so there's no need to make your life harder just for the sake of a recipe.    Already have bread cubed up and dried out for stuffing? Use that. Don’t have shiitakes, but you did buy a ton of creminis for a stuffed-mushroom hors d’oeuvre? Awesome, those will work just fine. Have more mashed sweet potatoes than you need for that casserole? Sub them in for the kabocha purée in this recipe; nobody will know, or judge.    Oh, and one final thing—if you have only a couple vegetarians coming over to dinner, you should absolutely stuff the extra pumpkins in this recipe with bacon or sausage, or both. Just make sure to mark them in some way, or Thanksgiving dinner could get even more uncomfortable than usual (and that’s saying something).      Before You Begin: Pick Your Pumpkins    One ingredient you will need to get is pumpkins. No, you can’t repurpose the rotting jack-o'-lantern that's been sitting on your front stoop since October. Sorry. What you’re looking for are small “sugar pumpkins” that roast up creamy-fleshed and sweet (truth in advertising!). As with all winter squash, pick pumpkins that are mostly blemish-free, with no visible bruising, soft spots, or mold.    A common refrain calls for choosing specimens that \"feel heavy for their size\" when you're selecting squash. I'm not sure I lift enough squash in my life to know exactly what that means, and certainly don’t condone pumpkin body-shaming, but in this case, you're looking for four sugar pumpkins, and one kabocha squash, that all weigh around two pounds each. (Of course, you can double or triple or even halve this recipe, if desired.)      How to Make Thanksgiving Vegetarian Stuffed Pumpkins, Step-by-Step     Step 1: Prepare and Par-Roast the Squashes    Once you have your pumpkins, it’s time to get to work, starting with all of the squash. First, halve the kabocha, and use a spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy pulp.    Next, prepare the sugar pumpkins. It's just like prepping a bunch of mini jack-o'-lanterns—use a paring knife to take their tops off, then go in with a spoon to perform the same seeds-and-pulp surgery. Make sure to clean the undersides of the tops as well (again, a paring knife gets the job done quickly), and try to avoid the temptation to carve a face.    Now, let’s talk squash seasoning. While we'll be stuffing the pumpkins with plenty of savory goodies, it’s important to properly season the pumpkins themselves. In early rounds of recipe testing, I took a light approach with salt and pepper on the pumpkins, and it made for an uneven dish, as the muted flavor of the pumpkin clashed with the confident seasoning of the filling.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    I hate eating at restaurants where dishes come with instructions telling you, “In order to enjoy this properly, make sure you get a bit of everything in each bite.” Food shouldn’t require a user manual; every component of a dish should be well calibrated for seasoning.    In this case, that means drizzling and rubbing the flesh of the pumpkins and kabocha with olive oil before seasoning them assertively with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. The oil provides not only fat and flavor but also a more adhesive surface for the salt and pepper to cling to.    I arrange all the squashes on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and pop them in the oven to roast for about an hour, until the kabocha is tender and the pumpkins have just begun to soften. Once they come out of the oven, I set the baking sheet aside to cool, removing the tops of the pumpkins to allow steam to escape. Once the kabocha is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and roughly mash it in a bowl with a large spoon. Season it with salt and pepper, then set it aside.    Par-roasting the pumpkins before stuffing them not only speeds up the final baking time on the back end of the recipe but also ensures that the finished stuffed squashes are perfectly cooked inside and out. That's especially important given that the pumpkins' flesh requires a longer cooking time than the stuffing ingredients, many of which are already cooked prior to roasting. While the squashes are in the oven, there's plenty of time to put together the other components for the filling.    Once the kabocha is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and roughly mash it in a bowl with a large spoon. Season it with salt and pepper, then set it aside.     Step 2: Cook the Mushrooms and Kale    While the pumpkins are par-roasting, I turn my attention to sautéing the mushrooms and kale. I start by heating a couple of tablespoons of oil in a 12-inch skillet until shimmering, then add a full pound of thinly sliced shiitake mushroom caps. At first, this may look like a ton of mushrooms overcrowding the skillet, but don’t sweat it—let the shiitakes do all the sweating.    They'll soon cook down, releasing water, and once that's happened, they'll begin browning. Make sure to actually let them get some good color. You don’t want to rush things and end up with a sad pile of steamed mushrooms. If your skillet gets too dry and begins to smoke, you can always add a touch more oil and reduce the heat a bit.    Once the shiitakes are golden brown, I push them to the outer edges of the skillet and add the kale. Again, what initially seems like an overcrowded skillet will soon be much more manageable as the kale wilts down. We aren’t looking to fully cook the lacinato here, just wilt it slightly, as we still want it to have a little texture and bite in the end. (Lacinato kale is much sturdier than the curly stuff, and therefore better suited for this recipe.)    I repeat the process of pushing everything to the outer edges of the skillet, then add a few tablespoons of butter to its now-empty center. Once the butter melts and begins to foam, I add minced shallots, garlic, and chopped fresh thyme, then stir constantly for a few seconds, just until I'm hit with the sweet smell of alliums and the woodsy aroma of crackling thyme. I finish the mushrooms with some sherry, plus a touch of sherry vinegar for acidity.     Step 3: Whisk Together the Spiced Cream    As I mentioned in the beginning, this filling is essentially a savory bread pudding, and that means we need some creamy liquid to moisten and bind everything together. While there aren’t any eggs in the recipe, I do use plenty of cream, cut with a little whole milk and seasoned with plenty of warm spices, including cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove.     Step 4: Layer the Stuffing             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Gather together the rest of the stuffing mise en place: cubed and dried bread, shredded Gruyère, and the toasted pepitas and pecans. It’s time to load those pumpkins up.    First things first—we'll be layering all of the components inside the pumpkins, twice. Keep that in mind as you begin dividing the ingredients between the pumpkins. I layer everything in the following order: a large spoonful of the mashed kabocha, a small handful of bread pieces, then some of the mushroom-kale mixture, followed by the pepitas and pecans, and then a showering of Gruyère.    To finish off the first layer, I pour half of the cream mixture into the four pumpkins, then use my hands to gently press everything down and evenly saturate the ingredients with the spiced cream.    Repeat this layering process once more, making sure there's a good amount of Gruyère peeking up over the rims of the pumpkins, so it can get gooey and melty in the oven.    Depending on the size of your pumpkins, you may have some leftover filling ingredients. I’m of the mindset that for a project like this it’s always better to have a little extra than not enough. If you have enough stuff left over, you can always put everything in some small ramekins and bake them, sans pumpkin.     Step 5: Glaze the Pumpkins    Since the goal is for every bite to be well seasoned, that means we have to give the pumpkin skins some attention. If we're willing to spend the time tending to the delicious, burnished, crispy skin of a Thanksgiving turkey, then pumpkin skins should be afforded the same care and consideration, and here that means a glaze.    I wanted to make sure that glazing the pumpkins wouldn’t make them too sweet, as I’m not a fan of dishes that are billed as \"savory\" but then pile more sugar onto the natural sweetness of squash. We’re trying to make a main course, not dessert. I decided on a simple mixture of red miso, honey, and a little bit of water—the salty funk of miso pairs really well with root vegetables, while the honey balances out that salinity and provides subtle, floral sweetness that isn’t overbearing.    After whisking this mixture together, I use a pastry brush to paint the glaze on the pumpkins. This step, I want to stress, is totally optional. If you don’t have miso kicking around in your fridge, don’t worry about it. The pumpkins will be delicious, glazed or not.     Step 6: The Final Roast             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    We’re now in the home stretch. Place your pumpkins back on that parchment-lined baking sheet, and roast them, without their tops, until that top layer of Gruyère is melted and lightly browned and the pumpkins are fully tender. (Use a paring knife to check them; the blade should be able to pierce the pumpkins with little resistance.)    Open the oven, replace the tops on your gourds, and bake them a few more minutes to make sure every bit of pumpkin is heated through. If you’re at all worried, you can always use an instant-read thermometer to double-check that everything is hot (at least 150°F/66°C in the center).             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Take them out of the oven and let them cool for a few minutes, until the cream settles down a bit. All you have to do now is carefully transfer them to a serving platter and portion them out as you see fit. You can either carve them up with a knife and pop a serving spoon in each one for cheese-pull scooping, or, if you have some famished vegetarians on your hands, just serve them individually. One pumpkin should be more than enough for two people, but it’s Thanksgiving. Unbuckle that belt, and do you.        11:39    How to Make Stuffed Thanksgiving Pumpkins", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Par-roasting the pumpkins ensures that all components of the dish are perfectly cooked.Adding layers of kabocha squash purée intensifies the deep pumpkin flavor.This recipe can easily be adapted to use ingredients that you already have on hand for Thanksgiving dinner."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/stuffed-pumpkin-vegetarian-thanksgiving-main-recipe"}

With a chicken, there are two factors that inevitably conflict with each other.    Above 150°F (66°C), breast meat dries out. Chicken breast meat is very lean. Looked at under a microscope, it's essentially a bundle of straw-like fibers filled with juice. As these fibers are heated, they begin to shrink, squeezing that juice out. Despite government warnings to cook chicken to an unthinkable 165°F (74°C), in reality, once you cook breast meat above 150°F or so, its muscle fibers are almost completely collapsed. Congratulations! Your chicken is now officially cardboard.Leg meat, on the other hand, must be cooked to at least 170°F (77°C). OK, that's a bit of an overstatement. It'll still be perfectly edible at around 160°F (71°C) (any lower than that and the abundant connective tissue will remain tough), but the juices will still be pink or red, and it will not have yet reached optimal tenderness. Unlike breast meat, leg meat contains plenty of collagen. Given a high enough temperature (160°F and above), and a long enough time (the 10 minutes it takes the legs to get from 160°F to 170°F), this collagen will begin to convert into rich gelatin, keeping the meat moist and juicy, even after the muscle fibers have shed most of their liquid.    So the question is, how do you cook legs to 170°F without taking the breasts beyond 150°F? I'm going to go ahead and give away the answer here: Butterflying (a.k.a. spatchcocking).             J. Kenji López-Alt      Why You Should Spatchcock Your Chicken    Why does this work better than any other method? Well, let's first take a look at some of the other \"fixes\" I've experimented with in the past:    Brining the bird (which we've already discussed in relation to brining a turkey) by placing it in a salt water bath for a few hours helps a bit. It loosens up muscle fibers, allowing them to retain more moisture as they cook, and giving you a slightly expanded moist temperature range for the breasts.    The problem? Well, first off, it's fussy. Secondly, it soaks the skin right through to the skin,* ruining its chances of attaining crispness (and let's face it, what's a roast chicken without crisp skin?). It also tends to dilute the flavor of the bird. Not so bad for robust turkey, but mild chicken needs all the flavor it can muster.    *Bonus points for anyone who can name that reference. Hint: classic 1960s comedy.    Salting (or \"dry-brining\") the chicken is a better solution. It works much like brining does, but rather than use a water and salt solution, you instead rub salt directly onto the meat and and skin of the bird and let it rest uncovered in the fridge for a few hours (or overnight).             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Initially, the salt draws moisture out through the process of osmosis. It then dissolves in this liquid, creating a concentrated brine, which eventually gets reabsorbed. So you get the benefits of the brine, without watering down the flavor of the chicken. It also doesn't saturate the skin the way a wet brine does. Sounds great, but it's at best a buffer, keeping the breast meat a little moister, but still far from optimal.    I've seen it mistakenly suggested that barding, draping the chicken with a fatty meat like bacon, or spooning melted butter or pan juices over the top as it cooks will help it stay moist. The theory is that some of the fat will get absorbed into the breast meat. Poppycock. That breast is shrinking, and it ain't absorbing nothing!    As much as I love most things wrapped in bacon, bacon makes the chicken taste like, well, bacon. And if I wanted bacon, I'd cook bacon. It also precludes the possibility of crisp skin.    Basting with hot pan juices not only increases the rate at which the chicken breast cooks, exacerbating the dryness, the moisture content in it (or in melted butter, which is about 18%), also keeps the skin from crisping properly. It's much better to brush the skin occasionally with oil (or rendered duck or chicken fat) as it cooks. This can help the skin brown more evenly, but it does nothing to increase moisture levels.    At the very least, if you're going to cook a whole chicken, you ought to truss it. What's the point there? Well, it plumps up the breast meat a bit, making it thicker. Thicker food takes longer to cook, so that keeps the temperature of the breast meat down a bit. It's the method Thomas Keller recommends, and was my go-to method for a while. But it's still not perfect, and I found myself often having to choose the lesser of two evils between dry breast meat or chewy thighs.    So far, all these methods are, at best, Band-Aids. They don't address the root of the problem. In order to perfectly cook chicken, you must find a way to cook it such that the breast meat comes to 150°F just as the legs reach 170°F. Performing fancy acrobatics in a roasting pan, such as flipping the bird (both figuratively and literally when you get splattered with hot chicken juice) three or four times so that the legs get exposed to the bulk of the oven's heat works, but there just has to be an easier way, right?    I've since switched over to butterflying the bird, and have always been impressed with the results, but it never occurred to me why it works so well until I accidentally burnt a tray full of breadcrumbs the other day. This is what they looked like:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Turns out that as the hot air rises from the bottom of the oven, the wide sheet pan creates eddies in the convection currents, causing whatever's at the edge of the pans to cook a little faster than the center. Now with a quick cooking item like, say, a cookie, this isn't much of a problem. But leave your breadcrumbs in the oven for a full thirty minutes, and you see it beginning to express itself.    Notice the center of the pan is much blonder than the dark, burnt edges? And notice how that blond spot is suspiciously breast-shaped?    Butterflying the chicken allows you to take advantage of this uneven cooking. By cutting out the spine of the chicken (perfect for making quick jus as the chicken roasts!) and flattening the carcass, you can arrange it in the pan such that the breasts lie right in the cooler center, while the legs sit closer to the edge of the pan, where they are exposed to more energy.    The result is a bird that cooks exactly the way you want it. Blast it in a hot oven (I'm talking 450 to 500°F or 232 to 260°C here), and you'll find that miraculously, the breast will reach 150°F (66°C) just as the legs reach 170°F (77°C) and the skin reaches delicious. No brining, no salting, no flipping, no problem.    Of course you do lose the prettiness of bringing a whole trussed bird to the table for carving, but you gain the vastly preferable prettiness of perfectly cooked meat instead, and that's a trade-off I'll take any day.      How to Butterfly (Spatchcock) a Chicken     Step 1: Cut out the Backbone             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Cut out the backbone of the chicken by cutting along both sides of the spine using a pair of sturdy poultry shears.     Step 2: Spread the Chicken             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Set the backbone aside for now, then spread the chicken's legs apart and flip it over so it is skin side up.     Step 3: Press and Crack the Breastbone             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Press down firmly on the chicken's breastbone until you hear a crack—that's the wishbone breaking—and the chicken lies quite flat. If you'd like, you can also remove the wishbone by cutting it out with a paring knife.     Step 4: Tuck the Wings             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    The chicken's wings are thin and can burn easily if left exposed. The easiest way to deal with this is to tuck them back behind the breasts. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and finish preparing it for roasting as directed in the recipe below.      How to Make Jus Using the Backbone     Step 1: Cut the Back             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    While the chicken roasts, make a simple jus to go with it. Start by cutting up the chicken back into one-inch pieces, using those shears or a sharp, heavy knife.     Step 2: Brown the Back             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Heat a tablespoon of neutral oil (such as canola or vegetable) in a medium saucepan until shimmering, then add the back and cook, stirring every so often, until it's nicely browned.     Step 3: Brown Aromatics and Deglaze             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Add a chopped onion, carrot, and celery rib to the pot, and cook them until they're lightly browned. Add a cup of vermouth or dry sherry to the pan, along with a cup of water, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. For better flavor, add a couple bay leaves and the stems from any herbs you used for the chicken.     Step 4: Simmer and Strain             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes, then strain it into a fresh pot, discarding the solids. Place the sauce back on the stovetop and let it simmer until it's reduced to about a third of a cup. It should have a really intense flavor by this point!     Step 5: Season and Mount the Jus             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Finish the jus by stirring in a small splash of soy sauce and lemon juice, along with a couple tablespoons of butter. Soy sauce will add some umami backbone to the sauce, while lemon juice brightens it up. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set the sauce aside until you're ready to serve.        3:53    How to Roast a Spatchcocked Chicken", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Removing the backbone and spatchcocking (a.k.a butterflying) the chicken makes it easy to get perfectly roasted breast and leg meat.Skipping brining and basting helps to ensure crisp skin.Rubbing the chicken with herbs boosts flavor.Saving the chicken backbone means you can make a flavorful jus for serving."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/butterflied-roasted-chicken-with-quick-jus-recipe"}

Sous vide is a fantastic method for cooking holiday roasts. It delivers reliably moist and tender results, frees up your oven for other tasks, requires almost no supervision during cooking, and makes it very easy to hold the roast hot and ready to serve until your guests are ready. That said, sous vide turkey comes with a few problems.    I remember the first time I tried to cook a turkey sous vide for Thanksgiving, way back in 2007. I bagged my bone-in, skin-on breast separately from a couple of turkey legs, threw some big hunks of pork fat in for good measure, then cooked the legs and the breast—at 165°F (74°C) and 145°F (63°C), respectively—all day and all night before removing them from the bags, searing it all off, and serving it the next day. It was an unqualified failure. Not only was the breast meat dry and the leg meat tough, but getting the skin to crisp properly involved creating a greasy, smoky haze in the kitchen, all while trying to chat with family members and drink my bourbon and beer. On top of that, the thing ended up tasting like, well, like pan-seared sous vide turkey, with none of the deep, roasty aromas you get from a typical holiday bird.    I've learned a lot since then, and I've been steadily tweaking my methods to produce better and better sous vide–style roast turkey. I think I've finally nailed it, and the timing couldn't be better, because with the rise of inexpensive home sous vide cookers it's easier than ever for home cooks to take a stab at what was once limited to the realm of restaurant kitchens.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt      Why Sous Vide Turkey?    Let's get one thing straight before we begin. Sous vide techniques are just that: techniques. They are another tool to add to your arsenal in the kitchen. Sous vide cooking is not better or worse than roasting, frying, or braising, per se—it's just different. The main advantage? It offers you very precise control over the finished product. While a hot oven ends up creating a large temperature gradient within a roasted turkey, a turkey cooked sous vide will be evenly cooked from edge to center.    One of the hard lessons I've learned over the years is that no matter what combination of time and temperature I try, and no matter what method of finishing them off post–sous vide, turkey legs cooked sous vide just aren't worth it. They're so darn forgiving that precise temperature control offers only the slightest of incremental improvements. I vastly prefer the flavor of more traditional preparations, like these red wine-braised turkey legs or this turkey roasted in parts.    The breast meat is an entirely different story. White, lean meat is the area where sous vide can really shine, delivering insanely moist and tender results unlike anything you can achieve through more conventional methods.    By essentially pasteurizing meat, sous vide cooking also allows you to safely cook turkey to temperatures that are lower than what can be achieved in a standard oven, and lower temperatures make for moister meat. This opens up new worlds of possibility when it comes to the texture and flavor of your finished dish. Confused? Let me explain.      Temperature, Timing, and Safety    It's easy to remember the \"165°F = safe\" and the \"40 to 140°F (4 to 60°C) = the danger zone\" rules. So much so that it's tempting to think of pasteurization as something akin to dropping a bomb into a fortress full of bacteria, instantly killing them all. But if you take a look at the USDA's website, the reality is actually quite a bit more complex. Pasteurizing a piece of meat to destroy harmful bacteria is really much more similar to a slow siege, letting the bacteria die off at a steady rate. That rate is affected by the temperature of the meat.      \"turkey cooked and held at 140°F for 30 minutes is just as safe as turkey cooked and held at 165°F for 10 seconds.\"   So, while at 165°F you reach a 7-log10 reduction in bacteria count (that is, for every 10 million bacteria you started with, only one will remain) in under 10 seconds, at 140°F (60°C), this process can take about 28 minutes. That said, turkey cooked and held at 140°F for 30 minutes is just as safe as turkey cooked and held at 165°F for 10 seconds.    Knowing the safety guidelines for this kind of pasteurization is the key to making sure that your sous vide turkey is safe. Here's a brief overview of the USDA charts:          Turkey Pasteurization Times     Pasteurization Temperature Time for 7-log 10 Lethality in Salmonella*   136°F (57.8°C) 64 minutes   140°F (60°C) 28.1 minutes   145°F (62.8°C) 10.5 minutes   150°F (65.6°C) 3.8 minutes   155°F (68.3°C) 1.2 minutes   160°F (71.1°C) 25.6 seconds   165°F (73.9°C) Under 10 seconds       *Note that these times are specifically for salmonella. Because it's hardier than many other common bacteria, pasteurizing with respect to salmonella will render your meat relatively safe. If you are particularly nervous about food-borne illness, you might consider pasteurizing with respect to an even hardier bacterium, like Listeria. Simply extend holding times threefold.    In a standard oven, it's difficult to safely cook turkey to anything below around 145 to 150°F (63 to 66°C)—you just can't hold its temperature in that range for a long enough period of time. With a sous vide cooker, we can cook as low as we'd like. So long as bacteria are actively being destroyed, it's just a matter of timing.    The important thing to bear in mind here is that these times start after the turkey hits the target pasteurization temperature. Even though water baths are an extremely efficient method of heat transfer, since turkey breasts are rather large, this can take an hour or more. The most precise method to ensure that your turkey is at its target final temperature is to cook it in a plastic zipper-lock bag, removing it after the first hour and every 15 minutes thereafter to monitor its internal temperature using an instant-read thermometer until it hits the right temperature.** You'll have to open and reseal the bag each time you check it using this method.    ** If you have a leave-in probe-style thermometer, you can monitor the turkey without removing it from the bag. Check out this video from Modernist Cuisine to see how it's done.      \"overcooking with sous vide is very difficult to do.\"   A much easier way to do it is to forget about taking internal temperature and just err on the side of caution. The great thing about sous vide is that, unlike roasting in an oven or deep-frying, in which 10 extra minutes of cooking makes the difference between moist, juicy meat and dusty cardboard, overcooking with sous vide is very difficult to do. An extra hour in the water bath isn't going to destroy that turkey of yours.     So What Time and Temperature Should I Use?    Okay, so we know about safety. What method actually tastes best?    Poke around the internet and you'll find a wide range of suggestions. The Modernist Cuisine recipe  mentioned above uses the lowest temperature, with the turkey not even hitting the 130°F (55°C) mark. Michael Voltaggio suggests 150°F. My own deep-fried turkey breast \"porchetta\" recipe calls for 140°F. So which one is best?    I started by cooking turkey at five-degree intervals for all temperatures between 130 and 160°F (55 and 71°C), then fine-tuned the most promising results. In each case, I set the target temperature of the sous vide cooker to a couple of degrees higher than the target temperature of the turkey—for relatively short cook times like this, it's more efficient to get the turkey up to its final temperature a little bit faster.    Here are some of the results:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    My personal favorite is 145°F for two and a half hours.

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    I'd nailed down the temperature I wanted, but that's really only half the battle. Next question: Turkey breasts have skin and bones. Do those really make a difference in the end product?    I cooked a couple of turkey breast halves from the same turkey side by side, one with the skin and bones intact, the other with the skin and bones removed before cooking. Afterward, I removed the skin and bones from the first sample before slicing the two breast halves and tasting them side by side.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    When slices were taken from the thickest part of the breast, there was absolutely no discernible difference between the two. Where small differences did start to show up was near the thinner, tapered end of the breast. The turkey cooked without the skin and bones was slightly mealier and drier.    This isn't because any kind of magical properties that the skin and bones have. They aren't transferring flavor or juices, as I've seen suggested. All they're really doing is insulating the meat, acting as an energy buffer so that heat doesn't travel into the turkey quite as quickly. When the thinner end of the turkey is cooked with no skin and bones, it rapidly reaches its target temperature. By the time the thicker part of the turkey is finished, the thinner bit is ever-so-slightly overcooked.    Though it seemed that leaving the skin and bones on might be the way to go, I wondered if there was a better way to do it—a method that would allow me to use the skin and bones for better purposes.    Short answer: There definitely is, and it's very similar to the method I use in that turkey porchetta recipe.      What's the Best Way to Shape a Turkey Breast for Sous Vide?    The goal is to get the turkey breast to cook evenly, right? To prevent the skinny end from cooking faster than the fat end, all you need to do is find a way to make sure that the turkey is of an even thickness throughout. How do you do that?             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    Just remove two breasts and pack them together top to tail, like a jigsaw puzzle. This will create a single large cylinder that is very close to even in radius throughout its whole width. Any minor differences can be evened out with a bit of butcher's twine tied at one-inch intervals.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    The other advantage to this method is that it allows you to season the interior of the breast roll as well. This is important not only for flavor, but for getting those turkey breast halves to stick together. As the salt works its way into the meat, it dissolves some of the muscle proteins, which in turn can cross-link with each other, binding the two turkey breast halves together into a single, solid piece of meat (even without the aid of fancy meat glues and such). It's the exact same process that helps a good sausage bind together.      What About That Extra-Crispy Skin?    You might've noticed a couple of glaring omissions here thus far. Namely, what about that extra-crisp skin I promised, along with the roasted flavor?    When you're roasting a turkey conventionally, that roasted flavor really comes mostly from the skin, as it's the only part of the turkey that's actually getting exposed to the high heat of the oven. For the meat underneath, I couldn't really care less whether it was in an oven or in a water bath—the final temperature is the only thing that matters.    Now, with my turkey porchetta, I wrap the rolled breast in its own skin before cooking sous vide, then finishing in a deep fryer. This gives it crispness, all right, but deep-fried skin doesn't taste anything like roasted skin.    The simple solution? Just roast the darn skin on its own. This here is a little trick I learned back when I was working for chef Ken Oringer in Boston.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    By spreading the skin out flat on a sheet of parchment, seasoning it well, topping it with another sheet of parchment, then sandwiching it between two rimmed baking sheets, you can roast it in a conventional oven. What you end up with is a single flat sheet of perfectly crisp skin that can shatter into serving-sized shards.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    What's more, because this skin isn't wrapped around steaming-hot turkey meat, it will stay crisp for far longer than the skin on a traditionally roasted turkey, all while delivering on that promise of intense roasty flavor.    I mean, just look at that:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    With the skin and the perfectly cooked meat, along with a gravy made from the trimmed-out breastbone, you've got yourself a Thanksgiving turkey dinner about as close to perfection as I can think of.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt    If you want to get extra fancy, you can plate up individual portions of turkey and skin for each guest. Maybe you can even get your mom to say what my mom's said to me on occasion:    \"This is so good, it almost looks like it was made by a professional!\"    Er... Mom, what exactly is it that you think I've been doing with the last 15 years of my life, huh?

At its most basic, a gata—also known as “kata”, “gatah”, or “katah”, depending upon who’s doing the transliteration—is a lightly sweetened, buttery Armenian cake, bread, or pastry meant to be served as part of a mezze (appetizer) spread, or with coffee or tea, or as a dessert.       Different Types of Gata    Some gata resemble croissants, made from an enriched bread dough rolled into paper-thin, table-wide sheets using an “okhlavoo” (a wooden dowel dedicated to dough work), smeared with butter, rolled up like a carpet and cut into spirals that bake up layered and crisp. Others are sweeter and decidedly more cake-like, whether they're made with a yeast- or baking soda/acidic dairy-leavened dough (baking powder was, until very recently, unknown in Armenia, so most chemically-leavened baked goods are made using a combination of baking soda and an acidic dairy like yogurt or sour cream). This latter style is usually formed into a flattened disc and filled with a single layer of a butter, flour, sugar, vanilla, and (sometimes) chopped nut paste known as khoritz, a mixture that's essentially the Armenian equivalent of streusel. These more simple gata are often dressed up with decorative strips of dough or by scoring patterns onto the top before baking.    When I set out to develop a gata recipe for Serious Eats, I was faced with the dilemma of deciding which style to choose from among so many. I didn’t grow up eating gata, and what I knew of the dish came from cookbooks and stories of friends and family who had eaten it on trips to Armenia. I knew I wanted something on the sweeter end of the spectrum—more coffee cake than savory bread—and I wanted to keep the preparation relatively simple. Which meant that the okhlavoo-rolled version was out; rolling out transparently-thin sheets of dough without tearing requires a lot of practice, not to mention miles of counter space. Since I am a bread person, and I knew I wanted some yeast in the picture, I chose to go with a walnut khoritz-filled cake made with a yeasted dough.      The Secret to Tender Gata Dough    The dough I created is buttery and tender, thanks in great part to the fact that it is moistened almost entirely with Greek yogurt. A single egg helps give the crust structure and lends it a pale yellow color, while a touch of baking soda helps to further lighten the gata’s crumb. As for the fermentation itself, I leave the dough at room temperature for 30 minutes to get a jump-start on proofing before it goes into the refrigerator for at least four hours (or as long as overnight). Chilling the sticky, moist dough in the fridge while it proofs makes it easier to roll out and shape when the time comes.              Serious Eats / Andrew Janjigian      Shaping Gata    My favorite thing about this gata—aside from its good looks and deliciousness—may be the way it’s shaped, which is both straightforward and forgiving: Once you've pressed and rolled the dough out into a 12-inch-wide round, you place the filling in the center of it, fold and pleat the dough over the filling until it's fully enclosed, and then you press and roll it into a disc again. It’s pretty easy to do, but the good news is—unlike other, similar preparations, like dumplings, which I’ve found are a challenge to shape prettily without lots of practice—the gata is very forgiving, because the dough is Play-Doh-malleable and the pleated part ends up on the underside, hiding any imperfections. As for the ornamentation, I opt for a simple crisscross pattern made with the tines of a fork on the top of the dough created, along with pleats around the outer rim. I mention this below, but it bears repeating: the dough puffs up as it bakes, softening the edges of the pleats and lines, so you should make them as sharp and dramatic as possible if you want traces of your art to remain.

Sicilian cuisine is famous for its mix of savory, sweet, and sour flavors, evidence of the heavy influence on the island of centuries of North African and Spanish rule. To produce that combination of flavors, Sicilian cooks turn to pantry ingredients like anchovies, saffron, pine nuts, and raisins, and toasted breadcrumbs. In Palermo, the region's capital, the way these staples are used together is evident in a trio of pasta dishes: pasta con le sarde (pasta with sardines), pasta c'anciuova e muddica atturrata (pasta with anchovies and toasted breadcrumbs), and pasta chi vruoccoli arriminati (pasta with stirred cauliflower).    My friend Salvatore Agusta, a native Palermitano and sommelier who also runs a business organizing street food tours in the city, compares this grouping of pastas to Rome's Big Four: \"It's similar to how carbonara, gricia, amatriciana, and cacio e pepe share black pepper, Pecorino Romano, and guanciale, with varying amounts of each and additions of other ingredients like tomato or egg to achieve dishes that taste distinctly different, but also echo and complement each other. In Palermo, we have our ingredients—anchovies for umami, saffron for floralness, pine nuts for nutty bitterness, raisins for sweetness, and breadcrumbs for their salty crunch. Combining them with sardines, or tomato estratto, or in this case cauliflower, gives us three unique pastas with shared commonalities.\"    For pasta chi vruoccoli arriminati, it's the intentionally overcooked cauliflower that sets the dish apart. Not to be confused with broccoli, Sicily's \"broccolo,\" or \"vruocculu\" in Palermo dialect, is what we know as cauliflower, and its peak season is in the fall. While most types of cauliflower will work for this recipe, light green varieties, like Romanesco, are ideal.      The Cauliflower    You start the process by trimming a head of cauliflower into florets and simmering them in salted water until they're tender enough to crush with a wooden spoon. You then add them to a skillet in which chopped onion has been gently cooked with anchovies in olive oil. Scoop some of the water you used to cook the cauliflower into the pan, along with the familiar cast of raisins, toasted pine nuts, and a pinch of saffron*, and bring everything to a simmer. At this stage, that cooking water is doing a lot of heavy lifting: it's helping to break down the cauliflower, plump the raisins, bloom the saffron, and soften the pine nuts. And now it's \"arriminare,\" or stirring, time.    Salvatore also recommends adding a pinch of fennel pollen, which complements the floral notes of the saffron (I tested this recipe with and without it, and it's a great optional addition).      Stirring, Smooshing, Swirling    As the sauce ingredients come to a simmer, get to work with a wooden spoon, stirring, smooshing, and swirling the florets, coaxing them to break down and thicken the liquid in the pan to take on a thick, saucy consistency. While that's happening, you cook the pasta until just shy of al dente in the same cauliflower-cooking water; short, tubular sedani or long bucatini are the shapes of choice. Finish the pasta in the skillet with the sauce, tossing a handful of breadcrumbs in at the last moment to give the sauce extra body, and then topping each serving with a final sprinkling for crunch. The nutty sweetness of the cauliflower plays off the pine nuts and raisins, the savory anchovies do their thing in the background, and even though it's got close relatives in Palermo, one taste will tell you this is a vegetable pasta unlike any other.", "comment": "", "website_specific_data": {"why it works": "Extended cooking and vigorous stirring makes cauliflower break down into a hearty sauce.Sicilian pantry staples—anchovies, raisins, pine nuts, saffron, and toasted breadcrumbs—strike a characteristic savory-sweet balance with North African influence.Tossing the pasta with toasted breadcrumbs helps to achieve the perfect noodle-coating sauce consistency, and a sprinkling of the same crumbs gives the finished pasta a crunchy topping."}, "source_url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/pasta-chi-vruoccoli-arriminati-sicilian-pasta-with-cauliflower"}

Yacai is preserved mustard root. It can be found in many Chinese grocers either sold by the piece in bulk, or in cans. Unused portions of yacai can be stored in a sealed zipper-lock bag in the refrigerator for several months.
