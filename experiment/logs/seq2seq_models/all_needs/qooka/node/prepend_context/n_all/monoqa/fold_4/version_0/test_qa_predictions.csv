Place it on a baking sheet. what should I bounce on the surface to dislodge any air bubbles? spoon What strategy is suggested to remove air bubbles from the batter? Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. what temperature in fahrenheit do I need to bake it at? 250°f What is the alternate baking method mentioned for a denser, paler cheesecake? Skip to the next step and bake only at 250°F until done; this may take an hour or more. how long should I leave the oven door ajar? 10 minutes What is the next step after turning off the oven and leaving the door ajar for 10 minutes?

Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. what kind of pan works well? roasting pan what should feel warm in the hot water? pan How should I serve the cheesecake?
