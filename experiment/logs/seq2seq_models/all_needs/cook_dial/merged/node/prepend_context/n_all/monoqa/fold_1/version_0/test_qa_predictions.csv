The oven is preheated. What next?  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Done. What to do with the oil?  Saute chicken and onions until chicken is evenly brown. For how long? until chicken is evenly brown Emm. It smells good now. So next thing is?  Stir in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, chile peppers, soup and broth. Then keep sauting them or is there more to add? <no_answer> Ohh. I add tomatoes. Can you give me two more?  Stir in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, chile peppers, soup and broth. Ok. I like spicy things! What else?  Stir in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, chile peppers, soup and broth. Good. So what should I do with the mixture in the skillet?  Bring mixture to a boil. I should also add some water, I think. Ok. I let them simmer for 30 minutes. Can I eat them?  Bring mixture to a boil. I have my own choice in this. Never mind. The broth mix is totally cooked now. What is next?  Remove chicken from skillet, and shred when cool enough to handle. I will let them cool for a while. ok. It is shredded now. <no_answer> Hard to measure this. I did it. Next is?  In a medium bowl, combine shredded chicken and about 1/4 cup skillet mixture (just enough to make a paste like mixture). They are in bowl now. Next?  Mix together with half the chopped green onions. Any thing else to add?  Pour remaining 2 cups of skillet mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Alright, many things on the board now. Shall I move the dish to the oven?  In a second skillet, heat cream over low heat, being careful not to boil. I heat the cream. What is next?  Dip tortillas in the warm cream to soften and coat. Coat them completely? <no_answer> No problem. We can continue, bot.  Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture onto each tortilla. Nice combination. Next?  Top chicken mixture with half the shredded cheese, and roll up tortillas. What kind of cheese? I don't remember its name. 3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese Ok. Thanks! Can I eat the rolls now? 3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese Ok. I will follow you, boss. <no_answer> Can you repeat the last part?  Place rolled tortillas in baking dish, seam side down, and drizzle with enchilada sauce. Thanks! Now I understand it. What is next?  Cover with remaining shredded cheese, and sprinkle remaining chopped green onion over cheese. Emm. It looks nice. Anything else?  Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbling. So after 25 minutes, I can eat them?
