 Context: Ingredients: 5 pounds whole skin-on, bone-in turkey breast, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1 large onion, 1 large carrot, 2 ribs celery, 1 1/2 quarts low-sodium chicken stock, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
 1. Carefully remove turkey skin in a single piece and set aside. Using a sharp boning knife, remove breast meat from breastbone. Set breastbone aside. Season turkey generously with salt and pepper on all sides. Place 1 breast half, cut side facing up, on a work surface. Place second breast half facedown, so the fat end aligns with the skinny end of the first breast half. Gently form into an even cylinder. 
 2. Tie turkey breast at 1-inch intervals using butcher's twine. Transfer to a zipper-lock bag. Turkey can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before proceeding. 
 3. Heat a sous vide water bath to 145°F (63°C), or to desired temperature according to chart above and in the notes section. With bag open, slowly lower bagged turkey into water, letting water pressure squeeze air out of bag until just the seal remains above the waterline. Seal bag completely. Let turkey cook for 2 1/2 hours (or according to chart). Meanwhile, make the crispy skin and gravy. 
 4. For the Crispy Skin: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Spread skin evenly over a piece of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place a second sheet of parchment on top and carefully squeeze out any air bubbles using the side of your hand. Place a second rimmed baking sheet on top and transfer to oven. 
 5. Roast until skin is deep brown and crisp (it will crisp further on cooling), 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool and set aside at room temperature. Turkey skin can be roasted in advance, cooled completely, then stored, loosely covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days. To re-crisp, place in a hot oven for a few minutes just before serving. 
 6. For the Gravy: Using a cleaver, chop breastbone into 1-inch chunks. In a medium saucepan over high heat, heat oil until smoking. Add breastbone, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add stock, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. You should have a little over 1 quart (900ml) of fortified stock; if not, add water or more chicken stock to equal 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside. 
 7. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add fortified broth in a thin, steady stream. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups (720ml). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm. 
 8. When turkey is cooked, remove from water bath and unseal bag. Carefully remove butcher's twine. Cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices for serving.

 1. For the Soup: Heat pumpkin seeds in the base of a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until they start to pop and smell nutty, about 4 minutes. Transfer pumpkin seeds to a bowl and set aside. 
 2. Add chicken, tomatillos, onion, peppers, chicken stock, oregano, epazote (if using), and a large pinch of salt to the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken and vegetables are completely tender, about 40 minutes. 
 3. Using tongs, transfer chicken to a large plate or bowl and set aside. Discard epazote sprigs (if using). Set a large fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the broth through it. Transfer solids to the jar of a blender. Add pumpkin seeds and cilantro to the blender. Blend on high speed until smooth. Set aside. 
 4. Using a ladle, carefully skim off a few tablespoons of fat from the strained stock and add it to the Dutch oven (it's okay if a little stock gets in as well). Heat over high heat, swirling and stirring until the watery stock completely evaporates and starts to form a browned layer in the bottom of the pan. (It will spatter a bit. The more you stir, the less it will spatter.) As soon as the chicken fat starts to smoke, pour in the contents of the blender all at once and cook, stirring, for about 15 seconds (it will spatter a lot—wear an apron!). Immediately pour in strained chicken stock and fat and stir to combine. Bring to a bare simmer, stir in hominy, season to taste with salt, and keep warm.

 3. Using tongs, transfer chicken to a large plate or bowl and set aside. Discard epazote sprigs (if using). Set a large fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the broth through it. Transfer solids to the jar of a blender. Add pumpkin seeds and cilantro to the blender. Blend on high speed until smooth. Set aside. 
 4. Using a ladle, carefully skim off a few tablespoons of fat from the strained stock and add it to the Dutch oven (it's okay if a little stock gets in as well). Heat over high heat, swirling and stirring until the watery stock completely evaporates and starts to form a browned layer in the bottom of the pan. (It will spatter a bit. The more you stir, the less it will spatter.) As soon as the chicken fat starts to smoke, pour in the contents of the blender all at once and cook, stirring, for about 15 seconds (it will spatter a lot—wear an apron!). Immediately pour in strained chicken stock and fat and stir to combine. Bring to a bare simmer, stir in hominy, season to taste with salt, and keep warm.

 1. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set all the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate. 
 2. Dry tuna steaks well with paper towels and lightly brush them all over with oil. 
 3. Just before cooking, season tuna steaks all over with salt and, if desired, pepper. Then set over hot side of grill. Cook tuna until first side is well-seared and the fish releases from the grill grate, 1 to 2 minutes. If the fish sticks, try to gently lift it from below using a thin metal spatula or the tines of a carving fork inserted down between the grill grates. Turn fish and repeat on second side. 
 4. For an ideal doneness of rare, cook the fish long enough to sear each side, and no longer. You should be able to watch the heat penetrate the fish from each side because tuna changes color so dramatically, from a deep purple when raw to a beige when cooked. Use the side of the fish to gauge doneness: if you want it very rare in the center, the sides of the steaks should still look purple, with the color of the cooked fish just starting to creep in from above and below.

 1. In a large straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, combine olive oil, garlic, and anchovies (if using). Cook over medium-low heat, stirring and breaking up anchovies occasionally with a wooden spoon, until anchovies have dissolved and garlic has softened and is just beginning to turn lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high and add wine. Bring to a simmer and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any stuck-on bits with a wooden spoon, until wine has emulsified with olive oil and mixture is slightly reduced, about 30 seconds. 
 2. Add beans and bean cooking liquid (if using cooked dry beans) or stock (if using canned beans), and, using a wooden spoon, crush roughly one-quarter of the beans against the sides and bottom of pan. Stir well, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until bean mixture is thickened to a creamy, saucy consistency, 10 to 15 minutes. 
 3. Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until softened on the exterior, but well shy of al dente and still uncooked in the center (about 3 minutes less than the package directions). Right before the pasta reaches this level of doneness, add the kale to the pan with the beans. Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer pasta to pan with beans and kale along with 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 2 cups (475ml) pasta cooking water. 
 4. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, 2 to 3 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. At this point, the sauce should coat the pasta but still be loose enough to pool around the edges of the pan; because of the starch in the beans and pasta water, the sauce will continue to tighten up in the time it takes to plate and serve, so make sure it's a little looser than you would normally serve a sauce.

 9. To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 10. Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside. 
 11. Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them. 
 12. Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms. 
 13. Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside. 
 14. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 15. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top. 
 16. Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack. 
 17. Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top. 
 18. Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top.

 1. For the Carrots: Adjust oven rack center position and preheat oven to 400°F. Place carrots in a large skillet and cover with cold water. Season gently with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender and water has mostly evaporated (If there's still lots of water left after the carrots are fully tender, drain.) Season cooked carrots with salt and pepper. Add thyme sprigs to pan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss to coat, and transfer to oven. Roast, turning occasionally, until carrots are lightly caramelized and wrinkled in appearance, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, discard thyme, and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. 
 2. For the Duxelles: Place mushrooms in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Add shallots and garlic and cook, tossing and stirring, until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and bourbon and cook until almost dry, about 2 minutes. Add breadcrumbs and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a bowl. 
 3. In a small bowl, toss bacon mushrooms with maple syrup until thoroughly coated. Roughly chop mixture and add to bowl with duxelles. Add half of parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil and fold mixture together until homogenous. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. 
 4. For the Cashew-Bean Mixture: Place cashews in a medium saucepan and add stock. Season very lightly with salt. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer cashews to the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl. 
 5. Spread beans on a foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Transfer to oven and roast, stirring occasionally, until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about 35 minutes. Transfer mixture to the work bowl of a food processor and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. 
 6. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and mushrooms are beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Add leeks and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper and add to food processor work bowl. 
 7. Process dried beans and mushroom mixture until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with cashews. Transfer sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to work bowl of the food processor and pulse until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with bean/cashew mixture. 
 8. Add remaining parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil to mixture and fold together. Season generously with salt and pepper. 
 9. To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 10. Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside. 
 11. Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them. 
 12. Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms. 
 13. Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside. 
 14. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 15. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top. 
 16. Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack. 
 17. Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top. 
 18. Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top. 
 19. Bake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes. 
 20. For the Gravy: While roast is baking, make the gravy. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk until flour is nutty brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in stock. Add soy sauce, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to 3 cups, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and lots of black pepper.

 8. Add remaining parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil to mixture and fold together. Season generously with salt and pepper. 
 9. To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 10. Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside. 
 11. Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them. 
 12. Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms. 
 13. Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside. 
 14. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 15. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top. 
 16. Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack. 
 17. Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top. 
 18. Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top. 
 19. Bake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.

 9. To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 10. Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside. 
 11. Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them. 
 12. Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms. 
 13. Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside. 
 14. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row.

Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 15. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top. 
 16. Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack. 
 17. Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top. 
 18. Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top. 
 19. Bake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.

 1. For the Carrots: Adjust oven rack center position and preheat oven to 400°F. Place carrots in a large skillet and cover with cold water. Season gently with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender and water has mostly evaporated (If there's still lots of water left after the carrots are fully tender, drain.) Season cooked carrots with salt and pepper. Add thyme sprigs to pan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss to coat, and transfer to oven. Roast, turning occasionally, until carrots are lightly caramelized and wrinkled in appearance, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, discard thyme, and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. 
 2. For the Duxelles: Place mushrooms in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Add shallots and garlic and cook, tossing and stirring, until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and bourbon and cook until almost dry, about 2 minutes. Add breadcrumbs and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a bowl. 
 3. In a small bowl, toss bacon mushrooms with maple syrup until thoroughly coated. Roughly chop mixture and add to bowl with duxelles. Add half of parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil and fold mixture together until homogenous. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. 
 4. For the Cashew-Bean Mixture: Place cashews in a medium saucepan and add stock. Season very lightly with salt. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer cashews to the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl. 
 5. Spread beans on a foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Transfer to oven and roast, stirring occasionally, until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about 35 minutes. Transfer mixture to the work bowl of a food processor and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. 
 6. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and mushrooms are beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Add leeks and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper and add to food processor work bowl. 
 7. Process dried beans and mushroom mixture until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with cashews. Transfer sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to work bowl of the food processor and pulse until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with bean/cashew mixture. 
 8. Add remaining parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil to mixture and fold together. Season generously with salt and pepper. 
 9. To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 10. Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside. 
 11. Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them. 
 12. Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms. 
 13. Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside. 
 14. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 15. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top. 
 16. Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack. 
 17. Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top. 
 18. Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top. 
 19. Bake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.

Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender and water has mostly evaporated (If there's still lots of water left after the carrots are fully tender, drain.) Season cooked carrots with salt and pepper. Add thyme sprigs to pan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss to coat, and transfer to oven. Roast, turning occasionally, until carrots are lightly caramelized and wrinkled in appearance, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, discard thyme, and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. 
 2. For the Duxelles: Place mushrooms in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Add shallots and garlic and cook, tossing and stirring, until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and bourbon and cook until almost dry, about 2 minutes. Add breadcrumbs and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a bowl. 
 3. In a small bowl, toss bacon mushrooms with maple syrup until thoroughly coated. Roughly chop mixture and add to bowl with duxelles. Add half of parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil and fold mixture together until homogenous. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. 
 4. For the Cashew-Bean Mixture: Place cashews in a medium saucepan and add stock. Season very lightly with salt. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer cashews to the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl. 
 5. Spread beans on a foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Transfer to oven and roast, stirring occasionally, until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about 35 minutes. Transfer mixture to the work bowl of a food processor and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. 
 6. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and mushrooms are beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Add leeks and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper and add to food processor work bowl. 
 7. Process dried beans and mushroom mixture until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with cashews. Transfer sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to work bowl of the food processor and pulse until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with bean/cashew mixture. 
 8. Add remaining parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil to mixture and fold together. Season generously with salt and pepper. 
 9. To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 10. Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a burrito, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside. 
 11. Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them. 
 12. Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms. 
 13. Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside. 
 14. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around. 
 15. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top. 
 16. Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (Do not oil final sheet of phyllo.) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack. 
 17. Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top. 
 18. Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top. 
 19. Bake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes. 
 20. For the Gravy: While roast is baking, make the gravy. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk until flour is nutty brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in stock. Add soy sauce, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to 3 cups, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and lots of black pepper.

 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler). Remove chicken from broiler and set aside. 
 10. Using an immersion blender and off the heat, blend contents of Dutch oven until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, transfer contents of pot to blender and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Add butter and cream, and blend until completely smooth and emulsified, about 2 minutes. At this point, you may remove 1 1/2 (360ml) cups of sauce and reserve it for another use. 
 11. To Finish: Add reserved broiled chicken along with any juices in the sheet pan to sauce and stir until chicken is well incorporated and warmed through. Ladle chicken and sauce into serving bowl and drizzle with additional heavy cream. Serve immediately with rice alongside.",2 pounds (900g),20

 Context: Ingredients: 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black salt, 14 g fresh ginger, 900 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds, 2 whole dried chiles de arbol, 1 pod cardamom, 1 whole clove, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 800 g whole fire-roasted tomatoes, 28 g raw cashews, 1 1/4 cups water, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 1 medium white onion, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 14 g ginger, 4 medium cloves garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler). Remove chicken from broiler and set aside. 
 10. Using an immersion blender and off the heat, blend contents of Dutch oven until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, transfer contents of pot to blender and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Add butter and cream, and blend until completely smooth and emulsified, about 2 minutes. At this point, you may remove 1 1/2 (360ml) cups of sauce and reserve it for another use.

 Context: Ingredients: 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black salt, 14 g fresh ginger, 900 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds, 2 whole dried chiles de arbol, 1 pod cardamom, 1 whole clove, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 800 g whole fire-roasted tomatoes, 28 g raw cashews, 1 1/4 cups water, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 1 medium white onion, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 14 g ginger, 4 medium cloves garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.)

 1. In a large straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, combine olive oil, garlic, and anchovies (if using). Cook over medium-low heat, stirring and breaking up anchovies occasionally with a wooden spoon, until anchovies have dissolved and garlic has softened and is just beginning to turn lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high and add wine. Bring to a simmer and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any stuck-on bits with a wooden spoon, until wine has emulsified with olive oil and mixture is slightly reduced, about 30 seconds.

At this point, the sauce should coat the pasta but still be loose enough to pool around the edges of the pan; because of the starch in the beans and pasta water, the sauce will continue to tighten up in the time it takes to plate and serve, so make sure it's a little looser than you would normally serve a sauce. Remove from heat, add 3/4 of grated cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season with salt to taste.

 Context: Ingredients: 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black salt, 14 g fresh ginger, 900 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds, 2 whole dried chiles de arbol, 1 pod cardamom, 1 whole clove, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 800 g whole fire-roasted tomatoes, 28 g raw cashews, 1 1/4 cups water, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 1 medium white onion, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 14 g ginger, 4 medium cloves garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler). Remove chicken from broiler and set aside.

 Context: Ingredients: 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black salt, 14 g fresh ginger, 900 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds, 2 whole dried chiles de arbol, 1 pod cardamom, 1 whole clove, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 800 g whole fire-roasted tomatoes, 28 g raw cashews, 1 1/4 cups water, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 1 medium white onion, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 14 g ginger, 4 medium cloves garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler). Remove chicken from broiler and set aside. 
 10. Using an immersion blender and off the heat, blend contents of Dutch oven until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, transfer contents of pot to blender and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Add butter and cream, and blend until completely smooth and emulsified, about 2 minutes. At this point, you may remove 1 1/2 (360ml) cups of sauce and reserve it for another use. 
 11. To Finish: Add reserved broiled chicken along with any juices in the sheet pan to sauce and stir until chicken is well incorporated and warmed through. Ladle chicken and sauce into serving bowl and drizzle with additional heavy cream. Serve immediately with rice alongside.",chicken,20

Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes.

 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler). Remove chicken from broiler and set aside. 
 10. Using an immersion blender and off the heat, blend contents of Dutch oven until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, transfer contents of pot to blender and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Add butter and cream, and blend until completely smooth and emulsified, about 2 minutes. At this point, you may remove 1 1/2 (360ml) cups of sauce and reserve it for another use. 
 11. To Finish: Add reserved broiled chicken along with any juices in the sheet pan to sauce and stir until chicken is well incorporated and warmed through. Ladle chicken and sauce into serving bowl and drizzle with additional heavy cream. Serve immediately with rice alongside.",immersion blender,20

 Context: Ingredients: 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black salt, 14 g fresh ginger, 900 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds, 2 whole dried chiles de arbol, 1 pod cardamom, 1 whole clove, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 800 g whole fire-roasted tomatoes, 28 g raw cashews, 1 1/4 cups water, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 1 medium white onion, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 14 g ginger, 4 medium cloves garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler). Remove chicken from broiler and set aside. 
 10. Using an immersion blender and off the heat, blend contents of Dutch oven until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Alternatively, transfer contents of pot to blender and blend until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Add butter and cream, and blend until completely smooth and emulsified, about 2 minutes. At this point, you may remove 1 1/2 (360ml) cups of sauce and reserve it for another use.

 Context: Ingredients: 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black salt, 14 g fresh ginger, 900 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds, 2 whole dried chiles de arbol, 1 pod cardamom, 1 whole clove, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 800 g whole fire-roasted tomatoes, 28 g raw cashews, 1 1/4 cups water, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 1 medium white onion, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 14 g ginger, 4 medium cloves garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: In a small skillet, toast fenugreek leaves (or fenugreek seeds, if using) over medium heat, tossing them constantly, until quite fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer toasted leaves to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to fine powder. Set aside. 
 2. In the center of a rimmed baking sheet, create a roughly 9- by 13-inch aluminum-foil boat with 1-inch sides, and set aside. (Alternatively, if you have a 1/4 rimmed baking sheet, use that instead, omitting foil.) In a medium mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, garam masala, salt, black salt, grated ginger, and ground fenugreek leaves. 
 3. Add chicken thigh pieces to bowl and, using clean hands, toss with marinade until evenly coated. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet, arranging pieces in a single, even layer in the aluminum-foil boat. 
 4. For the Makhani Sauce: Add fenugreek leaves (or seeds, if using), chiles de arbol, brown cardamon (or green cardamom, if using), and clove to small skillet and place it over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until spices are quite fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to spice grinder or mortar and pestle along with garam masala and salt and grind to a fine powder. Set aside. (See the note section for instructions on a shortcut spice mix using pre-ground spices.) 
 5. In a small, microwave-safe bowl, combine cashew nuts and 1/4 cup (60ml) water. Microwave on high until cashews look plump and have softened slightly, about 1 minute. Set aside. 
 6. In a Dutch oven, heat canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and baking soda and, using a wooden spoon, stir to coat onions in oil and distribute baking soda. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have completely broken down, most of their moisture has cooked off, and they begin to brown, 14 to 17 minutes. If at any point onions seem to be browning too quickly or unevenly, add a tablespoon (15ml) of water and scrape up any brown bits that form on the bottom of the pot. 
 7. Reduce heat to medium low. Add ginger and garlic to pot and cook, stirring constantly, until quite fragrant, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon, push onions into center of pot to form a mound. Add ground spice mixture to the mounded onions to prevent spices from scorching. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are coated in spices and mixture is very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cashews and their soaking liquid, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1 cup (240ml) water and, using the back of wooden spoon, crush tomatoes. 
 8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are completely broken down and liquid has reduced, about 40 minutes. 
 9. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to about 3 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Transfer chicken to broiler. Cook, checking the chicken frequently to ensure it's not burning, until chicken is charred in spots and is fully cooked through, about 14 minutes (time will vary depending on the strength of the broiler).

 Context: Ingredients: 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock, 30 g powdered gelatin, 800 g can peeled whole tomatoes, 225 g chicken livers, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 450 g ground beef chuck, 450 g pork shoulder, 450 g lamb shoulder, 60 g unsalted butter, 225 g diced pancetta, 225 g onion, 225 g carrots, 225 g ribs celery, 4 medium cloves garlic, 25 g sage leaves, 50 g fresh parsley, 2 cups dry white, 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup heavy cream, 85 g grated Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 pounds fresh pasta 
 1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place stock in a medium bowl or 1-quart liquid measure and sprinkle with gelatin. Set aside. Purée tomatoes in the can using an immersion blender or transfer to the bowl of a countertop blender and purée until smooth. Transfer chicken livers to a cup that just fits head of immersion blender and purée until smooth. 
 2. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add ground beef, pork, and lamb, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring and breaking up with a wooden spoon or potato masher until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in puréed chicken livers. 
 3. Meanwhile, heat butter and pancetta in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until fat has mostly rendered but butter and pancetta have not yet started to brown, about 8 minutes. Add onion, carrots, celery, garlic, sage, and half of parsley and cook, stirring and tossing, until vegetables are completely softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add cooked vegetables to meat mixture. 
 4. Return Dutch oven to high heat and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated from the pan, about 10 minutes longer. 
 5. Add wine and cook, stirring, until mostly evaporated. Add reserved stock, tomatoes, milk, and bay leaves. Season gently with salt and pepper. 
 6. Bring sauce to a simmer, then transfer to oven, uncovered. Cook, stirring and scraping down sides of pot occasionally, until liquid has almost completely reduced and sauce is rich and thick underneath a heavy layer of fat, 3 to 4 hours. If sauce still looks liquid or fat has not separated and formed a thick layer after 4 hours, transfer to stovetop and finish cooking at a brisk simmer, stirring frequently. 
 7. Carefully skim off most of the fat, leaving behind about 1 cup total. (For more precise measurement, skim completely, then add back 1 cup of fat.) Alternatively, let the sauce cool at this point and store in the fridge overnight to let the fat solidify and flavors meld. Then remove the solid fat, reserving a cup to add back in when the sauce is warmed. 
 8. Stir in heavy cream, parmesan, fish sauce, and remaining parsley. Bring to a boil on stovetop, stirring constantly to emulsify. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bolognese can be cooled and stored in sealed containers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or frozen for later use. 
 9. To Serve: Heat sauce in a large pot until just simmering. Set aside. Cook pasta in a large pot of well-salted water until just barely al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot and add just enough sauce to coat, along with some of the cooking liquid.
