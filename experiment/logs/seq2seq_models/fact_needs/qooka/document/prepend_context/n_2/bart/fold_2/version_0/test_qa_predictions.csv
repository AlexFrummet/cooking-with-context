graham,yogurt,"Question: How should the lamb be prepared with the yogurt mixture for this command? Place the lamb in a 1 gallon (3.8L) ziptop bag...pour the yogurt mixture over the lamb, seal the bag, and shake the bag to coat the lamb well. Alexa what should I pour over the lamb? 
 Context: Ingredients: 2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, 1 cup plain, 6 medium garlic, 2 inch fresh ginger, 3 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/4 cup ghee, 750 g white onions, 5 pods green cardamom, 1 stick cinnamon, 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon ground, 1/2 teaspoon ground mace, 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, 1 cup water, 400 g basmati rice, 1/4 cup lemon, 1 bunch fresh cilantro, 1 bunch fresh mint leaves, 1 chile serrano, 1/4 cup whole milk, 20 strands saffron, 2 teaspoons rosewater, 2 teaspoons pandan 
 1. Place the lamb in a 1 gallon (3.8L) ziptop bag. In a medium bowl, mix the yogurt, garlic, ginger, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt until combined, pour the yogurt mixture over the lamb, seal the bag, and shake the bag to coat the lamb well. Leave the ziptop bag in the refrigerator to marinate overnight. 
 2. Heat 1/4 cup (60ml) ghee or oil in a Dutch oven or saucepan with a heavy bottom over medium heat. Add the onions, season with a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions caramelize and turn dark brown (but not black), about 25 to 30 minutes. 
 3. Reduce the heat to low. Remove half of the caramelized onions and reserve to use as garnish for the biryani. Add 3 green cardamom pods, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, garam masala, Kashmiri chili, mace, and turmeric, and sauté just until spices become fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the lamb along with the yogurt marinade, the water or stock, and the cilantro, mint, and green chili. Stir to mix well, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover with lid, and cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lamb is completely tender. 
 4. Meanwhile, as the lamb cooks, prepare the rice. Pick over the the rice for any debris, then place it in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water, until the runoff is no longer cloudy; drain well. Place the rice in a bowl and cover with 4 cups (960ml) water and let stand for 30 minutes. Strain the rice, discarding soaking water. In a large saucepan, combine rice with 4 cups cold water, lemon juice, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, the remaining 2 green cardamom pods, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of ghee or oil and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes and then strain the rice; discard cooking water. It will be partially cooked—if you break a grain of rice, you will see an outer translucent ring and a tiny, opaque inner ring. 
 5. When the lamb is tender, remove lid and increase the heat to medium, stirring often to prevent scorching, and cook until the liquid starts to thicken and reduces to about 1 1/2 cups (360ml), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Using a clean, large wooden spoon or spatula, spread the rice out in an even layer over the meat in the Dutch oven. 
 6. Set oven rack at the middle position and heat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Place half the saffron threads in a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine powder. In a small saucepan placed over low heat, warm the milk just until it starts to bubble, then turn off the heat. Add the ground saffron and remaining saffron strands to the hot milk and let steep for 10 minutes. 
 7. Sprinkle the saffron-infused milk over the rice, followed by the rosewater and the pandan water. Garnish the top of the rice with the reserved caramelized onions. Cover the Dutch oven with two sheets of aluminum foil and crimp the overhang to form a tight seal, place the lid over the foil, and place the Dutch oven in the preheated oven for 20 minutes to let the rice steam. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot and carefully peel off the aluminum seal. Use a fork to loosen the rice a little and serve immediately straight from the Dutch oven. Alternatively, biryani can be transferred to a platter and served.",yogurt,16,ingredient

Add the lamb along with the yogurt marinade, the water or stock, and the cilantro, mint, and green chili. Stir to mix well, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover with lid, and cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lamb is completely tender. 
 4. Meanwhile, as the lamb cooks, prepare the rice. Pick over the the rice for any debris, then place it in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water, until the runoff is no longer cloudy; drain well. Place the rice in a bowl and cover with 4 cups (960ml) water and let stand for 30 minutes. Strain the rice, discarding soaking water. In a large saucepan, combine rice with 4 cups cold water, lemon juice, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, the remaining 2 green cardamom pods, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of ghee or oil and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes and then strain the rice; discard cooking water. It will be partially cooked—if you break a grain of rice, you will see an outer translucent ring and a tiny, opaque inner ring. 
 5. When the lamb is tender, remove lid and increase the heat to medium, stirring often to prevent scorching, and cook until the liquid starts to thicken and reduces to about 1 1/2 cups (360ml), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Using a clean, large wooden spoon or spatula, spread the rice out in an even layer over the meat in the Dutch oven. 
 6. Set oven rack at the middle position and heat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Place half the saffron threads in a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine powder. In a small saucepan placed over low heat, warm the milk just until it starts to bubble, then turn off the heat. Add the ground saffron and remaining saffron strands to the hot milk and let steep for 10 minutes. 
 7. Sprinkle the saffron-infused milk over the rice, followed by the rosewater and the pandan water. Garnish the top of the rice with the reserved caramelized onions. Cover the Dutch oven with two sheets of aluminum foil and crimp the overhang to form a tight seal, place the lid over the foil, and place the Dutch oven in the preheated oven for 20 minutes to let the rice steam. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot and carefully peel off the aluminum seal. Use a fork to loosen the rice a little and serve immediately straight from the Dutch oven.

bowl,bowl,"Question: what do I need to put the ingredients into? 
 Context: Ingredients: 10 1/2 ounces all purpose flour, 5 ounces unsalted butter, 4 ounces light brown sugar, 3.6 g baking soda, 1 g kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 ounce honey, 2 g orange zest, 1/2 ounce orange juice, 3 large egg yolks, 340 g dried Mission figs, 100 g unsweetened applesauce, 1 ounce orange juice 
 1. Prepare the Dough: Combine butter, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, honey, and orange zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add orange juice, then add the egg yolks one at a time and continue beating until smooth. Reduce the speed to low and sprinkle in the flour, mixing until well combined. 
 2. Knead the dough against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball. Flatten into a disc and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until cool and firm but not hard, about 1 hour. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature.) 
 3. Prepare the Preserves: Cut the figs in half. Pulse with applesauce and orange juice in a food processor until roughly chopped, then process to a thick, smooth paste. Scrape the bowl and blade with a flexible spatula, then process a minute more to ensure absolutely no chunks remain. Transfer to a sturdy piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours. (The preserves can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks; bring to room temperature before using.) 
 4. To Assemble the Cookies: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Knead the cool dough on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth, then dust with flour and roll into an 8-inch square. Sprinkle both sides with flour and roll into a 15-inch square. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen it, brush off excess flour, and cut into four 3 1/4-inch strips. 
 5. Holding the bag at a 90-degree angle just above the surface of the dough (this will force the preserves to flatten as they leave the bag), pipe a 1-inch-wide strip down the center of each portion. Fold a long flap of dough over each strip, brush away excess flour, and roll each bar over, seam side down.

 Context: Ingredients: 10 1/2 ounces all purpose flour, 5 ounces unsalted butter, 4 ounces light brown sugar, 3.6 g baking soda, 1 g kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 ounce honey, 2 g orange zest, 1/2 ounce orange juice, 3 large egg yolks, 340 g dried Mission figs, 100 g unsweetened applesauce, 1 ounce orange juice 
 1. Prepare the Dough: Combine butter, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, honey, and orange zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add orange juice, then add the egg yolks one at a time and continue beating until smooth. Reduce the speed to low and sprinkle in the flour, mixing until well combined. 
 2. Knead the dough against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball. Flatten into a disc and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until cool and firm but not hard, about 1 hour. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature.) 
 3. Prepare the Preserves: Cut the figs in half. Pulse with applesauce and orange juice in a food processor until roughly chopped, then process to a thick, smooth paste. Scrape the bowl and blade with a flexible spatula, then process a minute more to ensure absolutely no chunks remain. Transfer to a sturdy piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours. (The preserves can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks; bring to room temperature before using.) 
 4. To Assemble the Cookies: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Knead the cool dough on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth, then dust with flour and roll into an 8-inch square. Sprinkle both sides with flour and roll into a 15-inch square. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen it, brush off excess flour, and cut into four 3 1/4-inch strips. 
 5. Holding the bag at a 90-degree angle just above the surface of the dough (this will force the preserves to flatten as they leave the bag), pipe a 1-inch-wide strip down the center of each portion. Fold a long flap of dough over each strip, brush away excess flour, and roll each bar over, seam side down.

Transfer to a sturdy piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours. (The preserves can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks; bring to room temperature before using.) 
 4. To Assemble the Cookies: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Knead the cool dough on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth, then dust with flour and roll into an 8-inch square. Sprinkle both sides with flour and roll into a 15-inch square. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen it, brush off excess flour, and cut into four 3 1/4-inch strips. 
 5. Holding the bag at a 90-degree angle just above the surface of the dough (this will force the preserves to flatten as they leave the bag), pipe a 1-inch-wide strip down the center of each portion. Fold a long flap of dough over each strip, brush away excess flour, and roll each bar over, seam side down. Gently flatten each bar with your fingertips, then transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan (all four bars will fit on a single sheet). 
 6. Bake until the bars are puffed and firm, without any significant browning, about 18 minutes. Immediately cut into 1-inch pieces with a bench scraper, then transfer to an airtight container, with a paper towel between each layer and on top. This will steam the cookies and retain moisture for them to reabsorb, creating a uniquely soft and cakey texture. Cover and “mature” for at least 6 hours before serving; prior to that, the cookies will taste dry.

 1. Roast the Pumpkins and Squash: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Working with one pumpkin at a time, use a sharp paring knife to cut the top of the pumpkin off in one piece (as when making a jack-o'-lantern). Carefully run knife along the cavity of the pumpkin to loosen seeds and stringy pulp, then use a spoon to scoop them out and scrape the cavity clean. Using the paring knife, scrape seeds and pulp from the tops as well. Discard seeds and pulp or reserve for another use (try roasting the seeds with one of our seasoning combinations for a snack). Repeat with remaining pumpkins. 
 2. Place kabocha squash halves cut side up on a work surface along with pumpkins. Lightly drizzle the cut and inner surfaces of kabocha squash, pumpkins, and pumpkin tops with olive oil, rubbing them with your hands to evenly coat. Season heavily with salt and pepper. 
 3. Place pumpkin tops on pumpkins, then set pumpkins on prepared baking sheet. Set kabocha squash, cut side down, on the same baking sheet. Roast until kabocha squash is tender and can easily be pierced with a paring knife, and sugar pumpkins have slightly softened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Lift pumpkin tops from pumpkins to allow steam to escape and set all roasted squash aside to cool on baking sheet. 
 4. Once the kabocha squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and roughly mash with the back of the spoon. Discard squash skin. Season mashed squash with salt and pepper and set aside. 
 5. Meanwhile, Make the Mushroom Filling: In a large 12-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 10 minutes. Push mushrooms to outer edge of skillet, add kale to now-empty center of skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened and has mixed with mushrooms, about 3 minutes. 
 6. Push mushrooms and kale to outer edge of skillet and add butter to center of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun foaming, add shallots, garlic, and thyme to center of skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to a heatproof medium bowl to cool. 
 7. Make the Spiced Cream: After squashes have cooled and kabocha is mashed, whisk together cream, milk, cinnamon, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large liquid measuring cup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
 8. Make the Glaze (Optional): Whisk ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside.

 Context: Ingredients: 4 small sugar pumpkins, 2 pounds skin-on kabocha squash, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 pound shiitake mushrooms, 8 ounces lacinato kale, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 80 g shallots, 1 medium garlic clove, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, 60 ml sherry, 15 ml sherry vinegar, 2 cups heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 40 g red miso paste, 2 tablespoons honey, 15 ml water, 285 g rustic bread, 120 g pepitas, 90 g pecans, 225 g Gruyère cheese 
 1. Roast the Pumpkins and Squash: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Working with one pumpkin at a time, use a sharp paring knife to cut the top of the pumpkin off in one piece (as when making a jack-o'-lantern). Carefully run knife along the cavity of the pumpkin to loosen seeds and stringy pulp, then use a spoon to scoop them out and scrape the cavity clean. Using the paring knife, scrape seeds and pulp from the tops as well. Discard seeds and pulp or reserve for another use (try roasting the seeds with one of our seasoning combinations for a snack). Repeat with remaining pumpkins. 
 2. Place kabocha squash halves cut side up on a work surface along with pumpkins. Lightly drizzle the cut and inner surfaces of kabocha squash, pumpkins, and pumpkin tops with olive oil, rubbing them with your hands to evenly coat. Season heavily with salt and pepper. 
 3. Place pumpkin tops on pumpkins, then set pumpkins on prepared baking sheet. Set kabocha squash, cut side down, on the same baking sheet. Roast until kabocha squash is tender and can easily be pierced with a paring knife, and sugar pumpkins have slightly softened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Lift pumpkin tops from pumpkins to allow steam to escape and set all roasted squash aside to cool on baking sheet. 
 4. Once the kabocha squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and roughly mash with the back of the spoon. Discard squash skin. Season mashed squash with salt and pepper and set aside. 
 5. Meanwhile, Make the Mushroom Filling: In a large 12-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 10 minutes. Push mushrooms to outer edge of skillet, add kale to now-empty center of skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened and has mixed with mushrooms, about 3 minutes. 
 6. Push mushrooms and kale to outer edge of skillet and add butter to center of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun foaming, add shallots, garlic, and thyme to center of skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to a heatproof medium bowl to cool. 
 7. Make the Spiced Cream: After squashes have cooled and kabocha is mashed, whisk together cream, milk, cinnamon, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large liquid measuring cup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
 8. Make the Glaze (Optional): Whisk ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside. 
 9.

Using the paring knife, scrape seeds and pulp from the tops as well. Discard seeds and pulp or reserve for another use (try roasting the seeds with one of our seasoning combinations for a snack). Repeat with remaining pumpkins. 
 2. Place kabocha squash halves cut side up on a work surface along with pumpkins. Lightly drizzle the cut and inner surfaces of kabocha squash, pumpkins, and pumpkin tops with olive oil, rubbing them with your hands to evenly coat. Season heavily with salt and pepper. 
 3. Place pumpkin tops on pumpkins, then set pumpkins on prepared baking sheet. Set kabocha squash, cut side down, on the same baking sheet. Roast until kabocha squash is tender and can easily be pierced with a paring knife, and sugar pumpkins have slightly softened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Lift pumpkin tops from pumpkins to allow steam to escape and set all roasted squash aside to cool on baking sheet. 
 4. Once the kabocha squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and roughly mash with the back of the spoon. Discard squash skin. Season mashed squash with salt and pepper and set aside. 
 5. Meanwhile, Make the Mushroom Filling: In a large 12-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 10 minutes. Push mushrooms to outer edge of skillet, add kale to now-empty center of skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened and has mixed with mushrooms, about 3 minutes. 
 6. Push mushrooms and kale to outer edge of skillet and add butter to center of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun foaming, add shallots, garlic, and thyme to center of skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to a heatproof medium bowl to cool. 
 7. Make the Spiced Cream: After squashes have cooled and kabocha is mashed, whisk together cream, milk, cinnamon, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large liquid measuring cup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
 8. Make the Glaze (Optional): Whisk ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside. 
 9. To Stuff and Finish Pumpkins: Stuff pumpkins by evenly dividing and layering half the ingredients in the following order: mashed kabocha squash, bread, mushroom-kale mixture, pepitas, pecans, Gruyère, and spiced cream. Gently press mixture down with your hands, then repeat layering process with remaining half of stuffing ingredients. If glazing the pumpkins, use a pastry brush to paint glaze onto pumpkins and pumpkin tops. 
 10. Roast pumpkins on baking sheet, without tops, until top layer of cheese is melted and lightly browned, and pumpkins are tender and easily pierced by a paring knife, 30 to 45 minutes. Set tops on pumpkins and continue roasting for 10 minutes longer. Remove pumpkins from oven and cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Using a large spatula, carefully transfer pumpkins to a serving platter. Serve immediately.",oven,36,equipment

 Context: Ingredients: 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 medium cloves garlic, 240 g yellow onion, 1 large leek, 2 large carrots, 3 large celery stalks, 2 to 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1 chunk Parmigiano-Reggiano rind, 2 medium zucchini, 2 medium summer squash, 8 ounces green beans, 4 ounces spinach, 1 cup roughly chopped fresh basil leaves, 1/4 pound crusty bread 
 1. In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, heat olive oil over medium-low heat with garlic. Cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and very lightly golden. Add onion, leek, carrots, celery, and rosemary or thyme sprigs. Season gently with salt and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are fully softened but not browned, about 10 minutes, adding more oil as necessary if the pot looks dry. 
 2. Add tomato paste and stir until it is incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add 6 cups of water, bay leaves, Parmesan rind, zucchini, summer squash, green beans, spinach, and basil. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are fully tender, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
 3. Add bread, stir well, and simmer until bread is very soft and breaking down, about 15 minutes. Add water, 1/2 cup at a time, if soup becomes too thick and dry. 
 4. Season again with salt, pepper, and a generous shaving of Parmesan (if using). The soup can be served at varying consistencies: more wet and brothy, like a thick, chunky soup, or cooked down until thickened like a porridge. Once reduced to a thick porridge, you can ladle some of it into a small (8-inch) nonstick skillet with 1 tablespoon oil and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it coalesces into a dense mass; it will eventually take the shape of a pancake. (If your flipping skills are good, you can flip it to serve it browned side up.) Slide it onto a plate.

 1. For the Dipping Sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil in a small bowl and stir briefly to combine. Set aside. 
 2. For the Pancakes: In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour (or other flour), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and baking powder until well-combined, about 30 seconds. Set aside. 
 3. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together egg, doubanjiang (or other fermented bean paste), garlic, and water until mixture is homogeneous, about 1 minute. Add wet mixture to large mixing bowl with flour mixture and whisk together just until a smooth, loose batter forms; the consistency should be similar to pancake batter; it should flow easily off the whisk and puddle briefly on top of the batter in the bowl. Add additional ice-cold water as needed to achieve this consistency, taking care not to over-mix the batter. 
 4. Add salted cabbage (or kimchi), grated carrot, and sliced scallions to batter and, using flexible spatula, fold in vegetables gently until evenly incorporated. 
 5. Heat oil in 12-inch stainless steel, well-seasoned cast iron, or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Using a large spoon, small ladle, or measuring cup, add batter in 3-tablespoon (1 1/2-ounce; 45ml) portions (you can make larger or smaller pancakes as desired) to hot oil. For thinner, crispier pancakes, press down on batter to flatten them out; for thicker, fluffier pancakes, leave batter undisturbed. Cook, swirling oil once or twice, until pancakes are golden brown and crispy on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue cooking, swirling oil once or twice, until second side is golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer pancakes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet or paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Repeat process with remaining batter, adding more oil if pan becomes too dry.

 Context: Ingredients: 8 ounces water, 4 ounces unsalted butter, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 6.25 ounces all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, 1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese, 3 large eggs, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 2 tablespoons chives 
 1. Bring water, butter, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add flour all at once and stir with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to stir, beating dough forcefully and rapidly to prevent it from sticking to the pot. Continue cooking until dough pulls away from sides of pot leaving a thin layer and steams slightly. 
 2. To Finish with Stand Mixer: Transfer hot dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add mustard and cheese and beat on medium-low speed. Add eggs one at a time, allowing dough to fully incorporate egg before adding the next one. When final egg has been added, add herbs and beat to combine. Transfer mixture to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag or a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip. Proceed to Step 4. 
 3. To Finish by Hand: Remove pot from heat. Add mustard and cheese and beat with wooden spoon until homogenous. Add eggs one at a time, beating vigorously with each addition to prevent eggs from curdling and allowing dough to fully incorporate egg before adding the next one. When final egg has been added, add herbs and beat to combine. Transfer mixture to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag or a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip. 
 4. Let mixture rest 15 to 25 minutes at room temperature. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer and have a rimmed baking sheet. If using a zipper-lock bag, cut off a 1/2-inch opening in one corner. Holding the bag over the boiling water, squeeze the mixture out of the bag, cutting it off with a paring knife into 1-inch lengths and letting them fall directly into the simmering water. Continue cutting off as many as you can in one minute, then stop. 
 5. When all gnocchi have floated to the top, continue cooking until gnocchi are fully cooked to the center, about 3 minutes longer. Lift gnocchi with a fine mesh strainer or a metal spider and transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with a little bit of olive oil and toss to coat. Repeat with remaining dough. Cooled gnocchi can be refrigerated until ready to continue cooking in either the Parisian Gnocchi with Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Corn, and Zucchini, or in the Parisian Gnocchi Soufflé.",high heat,1,temperature

 Context: Ingredients: 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 2 teaspoons sesame oil, 100 grams all purpose flour, 50 grams chickpea flour, 2 g kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1 large egg, 17 g doubanjiang, 1 clove garlic, 2/3 cup water, 168 g kimchi, 60 g carrot, 30 g scallions, 1/2 cup vegetable oil 
 1. For the Dipping Sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil in a small bowl and stir briefly to combine. Set aside. 
 2. For the Pancakes: In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour (or other flour), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and baking powder until well-combined, about 30 seconds. Set aside. 
 3. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together egg, doubanjiang (or other fermented bean paste), garlic, and water until mixture is homogeneous, about 1 minute. Add wet mixture to large mixing bowl with flour mixture and whisk together just until a smooth, loose batter forms; the consistency should be similar to pancake batter; it should flow easily off the whisk and puddle briefly on top of the batter in the bowl. Add additional ice-cold water as needed to achieve this consistency, taking care not to over-mix the batter. 
 4. Add salted cabbage (or kimchi), grated carrot, and sliced scallions to batter and, using flexible spatula, fold in vegetables gently until evenly incorporated. 
 5. Heat oil in 12-inch stainless steel, well-seasoned cast iron, or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Using a large spoon, small ladle, or measuring cup, add batter in 3-tablespoon (1 1/2-ounce; 45ml) portions (you can make larger or smaller pancakes as desired) to hot oil. For thinner, crispier pancakes, press down on batter to flatten them out; for thicker, fluffier pancakes, leave batter undisturbed. Cook, swirling oil once or twice, until pancakes are golden brown and crispy on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue cooking, swirling oil once or twice, until second side is golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer pancakes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet or paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Repeat process with remaining batter, adding more oil if pan becomes too dry.
