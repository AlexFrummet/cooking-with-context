 Context: Ingredients: 1 pound dried cannellini beans, 3 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock, 3/4 ounce unflavored gelatin, 2 tablespoons duck fat, 8 ounces salt pork, 4 whole chicken leg quarters, 1 pound garlic sausage, 1 large onion, 2 stalks celery, 1 whole head garlic, 4 sprigs parsley 
 1. In a large bowl, cover beans with 3 quarts water and add salt. Stir to combine and let sit at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse beans and set aside. 
 2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Set aside. Heat duck fat (if using) in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add salt pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl, leaving rendered fat in Dutch oven, and set aside. (If not using duck fat, cook pork with no additional fat.) 
 3. Season chicken pieces with pepper (do not add salt) and place skin side down in now-empty pan. Cook without moving until well-browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken pieces and continue cooking until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with salt pork. 
 4. Add sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until well-browned on both sides. Transfer to bowl with salt pork and chicken. Drain all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot. 
 5. Add onions to pot and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cook until onions are translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add drained beans, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, cloves, and stock/gelatin mixture. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce to low, cover Dutch oven, and cook until beans are almost tender but retain a slight bite, about 45 minutes. 
 6. Using tongs, remove carrots, celery, parsley, bay leaves, and cloves and discard. Add meats to pot and stir to incorporate, making sure that the chicken pieces end up on top of the beans with the skin facing upwards. Beans should be almost completely submerged. Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until a thin crust forms on top, about 2 hours, adding more water by pouring it carefully down the side of the pot, as necessary, to keep beans mostly covered. 
 7. Break crust with a spoon and shake pot gently to redistribute. Return to oven and continue cooking, stopping to break and shake the crust every 30 minutes until you reach the 4 1/2 hour mark. Return to oven and continue cooking undisturbed until the crust is deep brown and thick, about 5 to 6 hours total. Serve immediately.",water,31,ingredient

 Context: Ingredients: 1 pound dried cannellini beans, 3 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock, 3/4 ounce unflavored gelatin, 2 tablespoons duck fat, 8 ounces salt pork, 4 whole chicken leg quarters, 1 pound garlic sausage, 1 large onion, 2 stalks celery, 1 whole head garlic, 4 sprigs parsley 
 1. In a large bowl, cover beans with 3 quarts water and add salt. Stir to combine and let sit at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse beans and set aside. 
 2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Set aside. Heat duck fat (if using) in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add salt pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl, leaving rendered fat in Dutch oven, and set aside. (If not using duck fat, cook pork with no additional fat.) 
 3. Season chicken pieces with pepper (do not add salt) and place skin side down in now-empty pan. Cook without moving until well-browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken pieces and continue cooking until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with salt pork. 
 4. Add sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until well-browned on both sides. Transfer to bowl with salt pork and chicken. Drain all but 2 tablespoons fat from pot. 
 5. Add onions to pot and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cook until onions are translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add drained beans, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, cloves, and stock/gelatin mixture. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce to low, cover Dutch oven, and cook until beans are almost tender but retain a slight bite, about 45 minutes. 
 6. Using tongs, remove carrots, celery, parsley, bay leaves, and cloves and discard. Add meats to pot and stir to incorporate, making sure that the chicken pieces end up on top of the beans with the skin facing upwards. Beans should be almost completely submerged. Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until a thin crust forms on top, about 2 hours, adding more water by pouring it carefully down the side of the pot, as necessary, to keep beans mostly covered. 
 7. Break crust with a spoon and shake pot gently to redistribute. Return to oven and continue cooking, stopping to break and shake the crust every 30 minutes until you reach the 4 1/2 hour mark. Return to oven and continue cooking undisturbed until the crust is deep brown and thick, about 5 to 6 hours total. Serve immediately.",all but 2 tablespoons fat,31,ingredient

 Context: Ingredients: 1 pound dried cannellini beans, 3 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock, 3/4 ounce unflavored gelatin, 2 tablespoons duck fat, 8 ounces salt pork, 4 whole chicken leg quarters, 1 pound garlic sausage, 1 large onion, 2 stalks celery, 1 whole head garlic, 4 sprigs parsley 
 1. In a large bowl, cover beans with 3 quarts water and add salt. Stir to combine and let sit at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse beans and set aside. 
 2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Set aside. Heat duck fat (if using) in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add salt pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl, leaving rendered fat in Dutch oven, and set aside. (If not using duck fat, cook pork with no additional fat.) 
 3. Season chicken pieces with pepper (do not add salt) and place skin side down in now-empty pan. Cook without moving until well-browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken pieces and continue cooking until lightly browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with salt pork.

 Context: Ingredients: 675 g Yukon Gold potatoes, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 sprig fresh rosemary, 50 g shallot, 5 g garlic clove, 165 g risotto rice, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1 teaspoons fish sauce, 1/2 ounce basil leaves 
 1. Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large baking dish, combine potatoes, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to combine. Spread potatoes in an even, single layer. Roast until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a piece of potato, about 30 minutes. Set baking dish aside to cool; keep oven on. 
 2. Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, cut top 1/2 inch off stem end of tomatoes and set aside. Carefully run knife along the cavity of the tomato to loosen core and pulp, then use a spoon to carefully scoop them out into a bowl. Repeat with remaining tomatoes. Season insides of tomatoes and their tops with salt, and place them upside down on wire rack rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Set tomatoes aside. 
 3. Using a food mill, pass reserved tomato pulp into a non-reactive container; discard seeds. (Alternatively, you can blend the tomato pulp with a food processor or blender, though it'll retain some seeds and will be a lighter color due to incorporated air.) Measure yield of tomato pulp by transferring it to a liquid measuring cup; you should have about 2 1/4 cups (530ml); if you don't have that much, add low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable stock to reach that volume. 
 4. In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until shallots are softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened as well, about 1 minute longer. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) Stir in tomato paste and continue to cook, stirring, until tomato paste evenly coats rice mixture and turns rust-colored, about 1 minute longer. 
 6. Add tomato pulp, increase heat to medium-high, and cook rice at a steady simmer, stirring frequently, until rice is just beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in fish sauce (if using) and basil, and season with salt. 
 7. Blot tomato cavities with paper towels, then nestle them into potatoes in baking dish so that they remain upright. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, set tops on tomatoes, and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) of olive oil. 
 8. Roast tomatoes until they are very tender and rice is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn oven to broil, remove tops from tomatoes (keeping them in baking dish) to expose rice, and broil until rice and potatoes are lightly charred and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes (keep a close eye as broiler intensity can vary significantly from one oven to the next).

 Context: Ingredients: 675 g Yukon Gold potatoes, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 sprig fresh rosemary, 50 g shallot, 5 g garlic clove, 165 g risotto rice, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1 teaspoons fish sauce, 1/2 ounce basil leaves 
 1. Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large baking dish, combine potatoes, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to combine. Spread potatoes in an even, single layer. Roast until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a piece of potato, about 30 minutes. Set baking dish aside to cool; keep oven on. 
 2. Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, cut top 1/2 inch off stem end of tomatoes and set aside. Carefully run knife along the cavity of the tomato to loosen core and pulp, then use a spoon to carefully scoop them out into a bowl. Repeat with remaining tomatoes. Season insides of tomatoes and their tops with salt, and place them upside down on wire rack rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Set tomatoes aside. 
 3. Using a food mill, pass reserved tomato pulp into a non-reactive container; discard seeds. (Alternatively, you can blend the tomato pulp with a food processor or blender, though it'll retain some seeds and will be a lighter color due to incorporated air.) Measure yield of tomato pulp by transferring it to a liquid measuring cup; you should have about 2 1/4 cups (530ml); if you don't have that much, add low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable stock to reach that volume. 
 4. In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until shallots are softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened as well, about 1 minute longer. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) Stir in tomato paste and continue to cook, stirring, until tomato paste evenly coats rice mixture and turns rust-colored, about 1 minute longer. 
 6. Add tomato pulp, increase heat to medium-high, and cook rice at a steady simmer, stirring frequently, until rice is just beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in fish sauce (if using) and basil, and season with salt. 
 7. Blot tomato cavities with paper towels, then nestle them into potatoes in baking dish so that they remain upright. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, set tops on tomatoes, and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) of olive oil. 
 8. Roast tomatoes until they are very tender and rice is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn oven to broil, remove tops from tomatoes (keeping them in baking dish) to expose rice, and broil until rice and potatoes are lightly charred and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes (keep a close eye as broiler intensity can vary significantly from one oven to the next). Remove baking dish from oven, and let cool for at least 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",1 tablespoon,25,amount

 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4-inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet. 
 2. Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks. 
 3. Transfer large squash chunks, apple, and garlic cloves to a food processor, blender, or the container of a stick blender. Add miso and 1/4 cup (60ml) broth and blend until a smooth purée forms. Season with salt. 
 4. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) 
 6. Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
 7. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged.

 Context: Ingredients: 3 1/2 pounds butternut squash, 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 medium cloves garlic, 8 leaves sage, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 teaspoon miso, 3 3/4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, 1 medium yellow onion, 400 g arborio, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4-inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet. 
 2. Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks. 
 3. Transfer large squash chunks, apple, and garlic cloves to a food processor, blender, or the container of a stick blender. Add miso and 1/4 cup (60ml) broth and blend until a smooth purée forms. Season with salt. 
 4. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) 
 6. Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
 7. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. 
 8. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate. 
 9. Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée. 
 10. Stir in brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce. 
 11. Stir in a generous grating of Parmesan cheese, followed by the maple-roasted diced squash. Season with salt. Spoon risotto onto plates, top with fried sage leaves and more grated cheese, and serve.",salt,34,ingredient

 Context: Ingredients: 3 1/2 pounds butternut squash, 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 medium cloves garlic, 8 leaves sage, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 teaspoon miso, 3 3/4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, 1 medium yellow onion, 400 g arborio, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4-inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet. 
 2. Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks. 
 3. Transfer large squash chunks, apple, and garlic cloves to a food processor, blender, or the container of a stick blender. Add miso and 1/4 cup (60ml) broth and blend until a smooth purée forms. Season with salt. 
 4. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) 
 6. Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
 7. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. 
 8. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate. 
 9. Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée. 
 10. Stir in brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce. 
 11. Stir in a generous grating of Parmesan cheese, followed by the maple-roasted diced squash. Season with salt. Spoon risotto onto plates, top with fried sage leaves and more grated cheese, and serve.",broth,34,ingredient

 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4-inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet. 
 2. Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks. 
 3. Transfer large squash chunks, apple, and garlic cloves to a food processor, blender, or the container of a stick blender. Add miso and 1/4 cup (60ml) broth and blend until a smooth purée forms. Season with salt.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate. 
 9. Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée.

 Context: Ingredients: 3 1/2 pounds butternut squash, 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 3 medium cloves garlic, 8 leaves sage, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 teaspoon miso, 3 3/4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, 1 medium yellow onion, 400 g arborio, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4-inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet. 
 2. Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks. 
 3. Transfer large squash chunks, apple, and garlic cloves to a food processor, blender, or the container of a stick blender. Add miso and 1/4 cup (60ml) broth and blend until a smooth purée forms. Season with salt. 
 4. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) 
 6. Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
 7. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. 
 8. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate.

 7. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. 
 8. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate. 
 9. Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée. 
 10. Stir in brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce. 
 11. Stir in a generous grating of Parmesan cheese, followed by the maple-roasted diced squash. Season with salt. Spoon risotto onto plates, top with fried sage leaves and more grated cheese, and serve.",4 minutes,34,time

 4. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) 
 6. Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. 
 7. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. 
 8. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate. 
 9. Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée. 
 10. Stir in brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce.

Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. 
 8. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate. 
 9. Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée. 
 10. Stir in brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce.

 1. For the Sofrito: Place dried peppers (if using) in a medium heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water (if not using, skip to Step 3). Place a weight or wet paper towel on top to help submerge the peppers. Let stand until peppers are fully softened, 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the peppers are very stubborn (as thick-skinned ñoras can be), you may need to tear a small hole in them to let water penetrate inside. 
 2. Drain peppers and discard stems and seeds. Using a paring knife, carefully scrape the flesh from the skins. Discard skins. 
 3. In a 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, red pepper, and scraped rehydrated chili flesh (if using), season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have released their liquid and are beginning to brown lightly on the bottom of the pan, about 6 minutes. 
 4. Lower heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring and scraping frequently, until sofrito is sweet to the taste and a deep golden brown color, about 30 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes longer. You should have about 1 cup. You can refrigerate the sofrito in an airtight container for up to 5 days. (Any extra sofrito not used in this recipe can be used as a flavor base for soups, sauces, braises, stews, and more.)

 6. Season chicken all over with salt, then add to pan and cook, turning, until deeply browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. 
 7. Add sofrito, paprika, and saffron, and cook, stirring and scraping until well mixed and sizzling. 
 8. Add stock (or water) and bring to a rolling boil. Season lightly with salt. Sprinkle in rice all over, making sure all grains are submerged and none are stuck on top of the pieces of chicken. Using your spatula, gently swirl the liquid around to distribute the rice evenly. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. 
 9. Cook for 8 minutes without stirring, then season shrimp with salt and nestle around the chicken thighs. Continue cooking until the rice is just al dente and the liquid has fully been absorbed, about 8 minutes longer; turn the shrimp during this time to cook them until pink on both sides. Reduce heat to low at any point to prevent scorching on bottom (though browned and crispy rice on the bottom is desirable). 
 10. If the liquid cooks off and the rice isn't done enough, add more boiling-hot stock or water in small additions and continue cooking until the rice reaches the desired doneness. You can also use a spoon to carefully dig into the paella and check the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing is burning.

 2. Drain peppers and discard stems and seeds. Using a paring knife, carefully scrape the flesh from the skins. Discard skins. 
 3. In a 3-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onion, red pepper, and scraped rehydrated chili flesh (if using), season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring, until vegetables have released their liquid and are beginning to brown lightly on the bottom of the pan, about 6 minutes. 
 4. Lower heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring and scraping frequently, until sofrito is sweet to the taste and a deep golden brown color, about 30 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes longer. You should have about 1 cup. You can refrigerate the sofrito in an airtight container for up to 5 days. (Any extra sofrito not used in this recipe can be used as a flavor base for soups, sauces, braises, stews, and more.) 
 5. For the Paella: In a 10-inch paella pan or straight-sided stainless steel sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
 6. Season chicken all over with salt, then add to pan and cook, turning, until deeply browned on both sides, about 8 minutes. 
 7. Add sofrito, paprika, and saffron, and cook, stirring and scraping until well mixed and sizzling. 
 8. Add stock (or water) and bring to a rolling boil. Season lightly with salt. Sprinkle in rice all over, making sure all grains are submerged and none are stuck on top of the pieces of chicken. Using your spatula, gently swirl the liquid around to distribute the rice evenly. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. 
 9. Cook for 8 minutes without stirring, then season shrimp with salt and nestle around the chicken thighs. Continue cooking until the rice is just al dente and the liquid has fully been absorbed, about 8 minutes longer; turn the shrimp during this time to cook them until pink on both sides. Reduce heat to low at any point to prevent scorching on bottom (though browned and crispy rice on the bottom is desirable). 
 10. If the liquid cooks off and the rice isn't done enough, add more boiling-hot stock or water in small additions and continue cooking until the rice reaches the desired doneness. You can also use a spoon to carefully dig into the paella and check the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing is burning.

stand mixer,an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan,"Question: Would it be okay if I just grease the pan without lining it with parchment paper? <no_answer> what do I need to use to contain the ingredients? 
 Context: Ingredients: 142 g all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 54 g white miso, 28 g unsalted butter, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 large eggs, 133 g sugar, 2 1/2 pounds apples, 1/4 cup water, 4 1/4 ounces sugar, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons white miso 
 1. For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling. 
 2. Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). 
 3. In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside. 
 5. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.) 
 6. Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain. 
 7. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated. 
 8. Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute. 
 9. Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern. 
 10. Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter. 
 11. Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer. 
 12. Meanwhile, for the Caramel: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 5 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, about 1 minute longer. 
 13. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low. 
 14. Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes. 
 15. Off heat, whisk in miso until smooth and combined. Transfer sauce to a heat-safe container.

 Context: Ingredients: 142 g all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 54 g white miso, 28 g unsalted butter, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 large eggs, 133 g sugar, 2 1/2 pounds apples, 1/4 cup water, 4 1/4 ounces sugar, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons white miso 
 1. For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling. 
 2. Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). 
 3. In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside. 
 5. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.) 
 6. Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain. 
 7. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated. 
 8. Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute. 
 9. Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern. 
 10. Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter. 
 11. Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer. 
 12. Meanwhile, for the Caramel: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 5 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, about 1 minute longer. 
 13. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low. 
 14. Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes. 
 15. Off heat, whisk in miso until smooth and combined. Transfer sauce to a heat-safe container.

 Context: Ingredients: 142 g all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 54 g white miso, 28 g unsalted butter, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 large eggs, 133 g sugar, 2 1/2 pounds apples, 1/4 cup water, 4 1/4 ounces sugar, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons white miso 
 1. For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling. 
 2. Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). 
 3. In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside. 
 5. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.) 
 6. Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain. 
 7. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated. 
 8. Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute. 
 9. Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern. 
 10. Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter. 
 11. Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer. 
 12. Meanwhile, for the Caramel: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 5 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, about 1 minute longer. 
 13. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low. 
 14. Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes. 
 15. Off heat, whisk in miso until smooth and combined. Transfer sauce to a heat-safe container.

 Context: Ingredients: 142 g all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 54 g white miso, 28 g unsalted butter, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 large eggs, 133 g sugar, 2 1/2 pounds apples, 1/4 cup water, 4 1/4 ounces sugar, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons white miso 
 1. For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling. 
 2. Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). 
 3. In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside. 
 5. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.) 
 6. Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain. 
 7. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated. 
 8. Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute. 
 9. Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern. 
 10. Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter. 
 11. Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer. 
 12. Meanwhile, for the Caramel: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 5 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, about 1 minute longer. 
 13. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low. 
 14. Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes.

 Context: Ingredients: 142 g all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 54 g white miso, 28 g unsalted butter, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 large eggs, 133 g sugar, 2 1/2 pounds apples, 1/4 cup water, 4 1/4 ounces sugar, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons white miso 
 1. For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling. 
 2. Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). 
 3. In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside. 
 5. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.) 
 6. Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain. 
 7. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated. 
 8. Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute. 
 9. Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern. 
 10. Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter. 
 11. Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer. 
 12. Meanwhile, for the Caramel: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, about 4 minutes, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 5 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is light to medium amber, about 1 minute longer. 
 13. Immediately add cream and reduce heat to medium-low. 
 14. Stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula to knock back the foam, simmer until caramel registers 225°F (107°C) on a digital thermometer, about 3 minutes. 
 15. Off heat, whisk in miso until smooth and combined. Transfer sauce to a heat-safe container. 
 16. To serve, using a serrated knife, cut cake into 1-inch thick slices and serve with warm or room temperature caramel.",for 10 minutes,19,time

 Context: Ingredients: 142 g all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 54 g white miso, 28 g unsalted butter, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 large eggs, 133 g sugar, 2 1/2 pounds apples, 1/4 cup water, 4 1/4 ounces sugar, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tablespoons white miso 
 1. For the Cake: Grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line with a 8- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper so that parchment hangs over the long sides of the pan, forming a sling. 
 2. Grease exposed sides of parchment paper, then dust with flour, making sure to lightly coat bottom and sides; carefully tap out excess flour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). 
 3. In a small bowl, whisk flour and baking powder until well combined, at least 30 seconds; set bowl aside. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk miso and butter until miso is broken up. Whisk in roughly 2 tablespoons of milk until mixture is smooth and no lumps remain, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining milk until smooth; set aside. 
 5. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk eggs and sugar at medium speed until pale and glossy, 60 to 90 seconds. (Alternatively, beat eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl using an electric handheld mixer or a whisk, about 90 seconds for the electric mixer and 2 minutes for the whisk.) 
 6. Whisk in half of flour mixture until just combined. Whisk in milk mixture, followed by remaining flour mixture, until no lumps remain. 
 7. Using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir apples into batter until evenly coated. 
 8. Using clean hands, arrange apple slices in prepared loaf pan in an overlapping pattern, making sure that flat sides of the apples are flush with the edges of pan (as you work, reserve some of the largest, nicest apple slices for the top layer; you'll need roughly 40 to 50 slices for it). Continue arranging apples in even layers until apples are 1/2 inch from top; press apples down to evenly distribute. 
 9. Arrange final layer of apples in horizontal, shingled pattern. 
 10. Scrape remaining batter into pan, making sure to leave 1/4 inch space from top; gently tap pan to knock out air pockets and distribute batter. 
 11. Set loaf pan on middle rack of oven and slide a rimmed baking sheet on the rack underneath to catch any drips. Bake until top is golden brown and domed and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center meets little resistance and comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes; rotate pan one time halfway through baking. Transfer cake to wire rack and cool for 10 minutes; loosen sides with butter knife or offset spatula. Cool cake in pan to about 140°F (60°C), about 2 hours. Then lift loaf using overhanging parchment and transfer to a cutting board. Let cake cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour longer.

 Context: Ingredients: 1000 g all-purpose flour, 700 g water, 22 g salt, 4 g instant yeast, 1 teaspoon vegetable 
 1. If using instant or fresh yeast, combine flour and all of the water in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If using active dry yeast, combine flour with 650g water and combine yeast with 50g warm water; let yeast stand until foamy. Mix flour and water at low speed until they are fully incorporated and form a uniform dough. Alternatively, combine flour and water in a mixing bowl and mix using a dough spatula until dough forms. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. 
 2. Add salt, along with either the instant yeast, fresh yeast, or the active-dry yeast solution, and mix at low speed or by hand until salt and yeast are fully incorporated and dough is smooth. 
 3. Turn stand mixer up to medium-high speed and mix until the dough feels elastic and bounces partway back when indented with your thumb, about 3-5 minutes. If mixing by hand, skip this step. 
 4. Working with oiled hands, gently transfer dough, being careful not to tear its surface, to a lightly oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Uncover dough. Working with wet hands and/or a plastic bench scraper, loosen the dough, then gently lift and pull the dough down towards you, folding it in half. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat, folding the dough in half towards you. Now give the bowl a half turn and repeat the fold a final time, being careful not to compress it too much. Lastly, pull the unfolded side of your dough carefully up from the bottom, and pull it up and over to form a neat package. Re-cover with plastic wrap and let stand until dough has increased in volume by half, about 1 hour 30 minutes longer. 
 5. Transfer dough in one piece to a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench knife, divide dough in half and shape each portion into a ball. Dust the tops of the dough balls with flour, cover with a towel, and let rest for 15 minutes. 
 6. Shape the dough into rounds once again, gently folding the dough over itself similar to how you did before, but even more carefully now. Now flip the dough ball over so that the seams you just created are on the bottom and a smooth surface is on top. Let dough rest on the work surface, seam-side down, for 5 minutes. Transfer each dough ball, seam-side up, to a bowl or basket lined with a lightly floured linen cloth or plain, not-fuzzy kitchen towel. Refrigerate dough balls or store in a cool place until dough has nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. 
 7. Meanwhile, set a Dutch oven on the oven's bottom rack and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) (If your oven has a convection setting, do not use it.) 
 8. Remove 1 loaf from the refrigerator and gently turn it out, seam-side down, into the preheated Dutch oven. With a razor or paring knife, score the full surface of the dough with 2 parallel lines roughly 3 inches apart. With a spray bottle filled with water, lightly spritz the surface of the dough.

 Context: Ingredients: 1000 g all-purpose flour, 700 g water, 22 g salt, 4 g instant yeast, 1 teaspoon vegetable 
 1. If using instant or fresh yeast, combine flour and all of the water in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If using active dry yeast, combine flour with 650g water and combine yeast with 50g warm water; let yeast stand until foamy. Mix flour and water at low speed until they are fully incorporated and form a uniform dough. Alternatively, combine flour and water in a mixing bowl and mix using a dough spatula until dough forms. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. 
 2. Add salt, along with either the instant yeast, fresh yeast, or the active-dry yeast solution, and mix at low speed or by hand until salt and yeast are fully incorporated and dough is smooth. 
 3. Turn stand mixer up to medium-high speed and mix until the dough feels elastic and bounces partway back when indented with your thumb, about 3-5 minutes. If mixing by hand, skip this step. 
 4. Working with oiled hands, gently transfer dough, being careful not to tear its surface, to a lightly oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Uncover dough. Working with wet hands and/or a plastic bench scraper, loosen the dough, then gently lift and pull the dough down towards you, folding it in half. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat, folding the dough in half towards you. Now give the bowl a half turn and repeat the fold a final time, being careful not to compress it too much. Lastly, pull the unfolded side of your dough carefully up from the bottom, and pull it up and over to form a neat package. Re-cover with plastic wrap and let stand until dough has increased in volume by half, about 1 hour 30 minutes longer. 
 5. Transfer dough in one piece to a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench knife, divide dough in half and shape each portion into a ball. Dust the tops of the dough balls with flour, cover with a towel, and let rest for 15 minutes. 
 6. Shape the dough into rounds once again, gently folding the dough over itself similar to how you did before, but even more carefully now. Now flip the dough ball over so that the seams you just created are on the bottom and a smooth surface is on top. Let dough rest on the work surface, seam-side down, for 5 minutes. Transfer each dough ball, seam-side up, to a bowl or basket lined with a lightly floured linen cloth or plain, not-fuzzy kitchen towel. Refrigerate dough balls or store in a cool place until dough has nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. 
 7. Meanwhile, set a Dutch oven on the oven's bottom rack and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) (If your oven has a convection setting, do not use it.) 
 8. Remove 1 loaf from the refrigerator and gently turn it out, seam-side down, into the preheated Dutch oven. With a razor or paring knife, score the full surface of the dough with 2 parallel lines roughly 3 inches apart. With a spray bottle filled with water, lightly spritz the surface of the dough. Cover and bake for 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 450°F (235°C) and bake for 15 minutes longer. Uncover and bake until crust is dark brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. 
 9. Transfer loaf to a wire rack. Allow to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing. Return Dutch oven to oven, and reheat at 500°F for 10 minutes. Then repeat with the remaining ball of dough.",bowl,4,equipment

 Context: Ingredients: 1000 g all-purpose flour, 700 g water, 22 g salt, 4 g instant yeast, 1 teaspoon vegetable 
 1. If using instant or fresh yeast, combine flour and all of the water in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If using active dry yeast, combine flour with 650g water and combine yeast with 50g warm water; let yeast stand until foamy. Mix flour and water at low speed until they are fully incorporated and form a uniform dough. Alternatively, combine flour and water in a mixing bowl and mix using a dough spatula until dough forms. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. 
 2. Add salt, along with either the instant yeast, fresh yeast, or the active-dry yeast solution, and mix at low speed or by hand until salt and yeast are fully incorporated and dough is smooth. 
 3. Turn stand mixer up to medium-high speed and mix until the dough feels elastic and bounces partway back when indented with your thumb, about 3-5 minutes. If mixing by hand, skip this step. 
 4. Working with oiled hands, gently transfer dough, being careful not to tear its surface, to a lightly oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Uncover dough. Working with wet hands and/or a plastic bench scraper, loosen the dough, then gently lift and pull the dough down towards you, folding it in half. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat, folding the dough in half towards you. Now give the bowl a half turn and repeat the fold a final time, being careful not to compress it too much. Lastly, pull the unfolded side of your dough carefully up from the bottom, and pull it up and over to form a neat package. Re-cover with plastic wrap and let stand until dough has increased in volume by half, about 1 hour 30 minutes longer. 
 5. Transfer dough in one piece to a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench knife, divide dough in half and shape each portion into a ball. Dust the tops of the dough balls with flour, cover with a towel, and let rest for 15 minutes. 
 6. Shape the dough into rounds once again, gently folding the dough over itself similar to how you did before, but even more carefully now. Now flip the dough ball over so that the seams you just created are on the bottom and a smooth surface is on top. Let dough rest on the work surface, seam-side down, for 5 minutes. Transfer each dough ball, seam-side up, to a bowl or basket lined with a lightly floured linen cloth or plain, not-fuzzy kitchen towel. Refrigerate dough balls or store in a cool place until dough has nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. 
 7. Meanwhile, set a Dutch oven on the oven's bottom rack and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) (If your oven has a convection setting, do not use it.) 
 8. Remove 1 loaf from the refrigerator and gently turn it out, seam-side down, into the preheated Dutch oven. With a razor or paring knife, score the full surface of the dough with 2 parallel lines roughly 3 inches apart. With a spray bottle filled with water, lightly spritz the surface of the dough.
