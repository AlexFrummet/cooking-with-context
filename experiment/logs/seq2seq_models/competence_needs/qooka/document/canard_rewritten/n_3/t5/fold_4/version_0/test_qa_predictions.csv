 Context: Ingredients: 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 700 to 800 g cauliflower, 60 ml extra-virgin olive oil, 115 g yellow onion, 15 g anchovy fillets, 30 g golden raisins, 30 g pine nuts, 340 g dried pasta, 60 g) breadcrumbs 
 1. For the Toasted Breadcrumbs: If using fresh or lightly stale bread, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325째F (165째C). (If using fully stale and dried bread, skip baking step.) Arrange bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake until completely dried, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Transfer bread to food processor bowl (set aside but don't clean rimmed baking sheet), and pulse until reduced to small crumbs, taking care not to over-process into a fine powder, 8 to 10 pulses. 
 2. Combine breadcrumbs and 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a large skillet and cook over medium-low heat, stirring and tossing occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer toasted breadcrumbs to reserved rimmed baking sheet, spread into an even layer, and set aside to cool to room temperature; wipe out skillet. Once cool, set aside 1/2 cup (60g) toasted breadcrumbs for the pasta, and transfer remaining crumbs to an airtight container for future use; the extra breadcrumbs can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. 
 3. For the Pasta: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add cauliflower and cook at a rapid simmer, stirring occasionally, until floret pieces are very tender and offer no resistance when poked with a paring knife at thickest part of stem end, about 10 minutes. Using a spider skimmer, fine-mesh strainer, or slotted spoon, drain cauliflower while keeping boiling water in the pot; transfer cauliflower to a bowl or plate and set aside. 
 4. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add anchovies and cook, stirring and breaking up anchovies occasionally with a wooden spoon, until anchovies have dissolved, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add cauliflower to skillet along with 1 cup (240ml) reserved cooking water, raisins, pine nuts, saffron, and fennel pollen (if using). Season lightly with salt, bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring and breaking up cauliflower with a wooden spoon, until florets break down to form a thick, yellow-tinged sauce (thanks to the saffron), 8 to 10 minutes. Add more cooking water in 1/4-cup (60ml) increments as needed to ensure there is enough liquid in the pan to coax cauliflower into breaking down into a saucy consistency. 
 6. Meanwhile, cook pasta in the reserved pot of boiling water used for cooking the cauliflower until pasta is just shy of al dente (about 2 minutes less than the package directs). Using a spider skimmer (or tongs if cooking bucatini), transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water.

 Context: Ingredients: 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 700 to 800 g cauliflower, 60 ml extra-virgin olive oil, 115 g yellow onion, 15 g anchovy fillets, 30 g golden raisins, 30 g pine nuts, 340 g dried pasta, 60 g) breadcrumbs 
 1. For the Toasted Breadcrumbs: If using fresh or lightly stale bread, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325째F (165째C). (If using fully stale and dried bread, skip baking step.) Arrange bread in single layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake until completely dried, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Transfer bread to food processor bowl (set aside but don't clean rimmed baking sheet), and pulse until reduced to small crumbs, taking care not to over-process into a fine powder, 8 to 10 pulses. 
 2. Combine breadcrumbs and 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a large skillet and cook over medium-low heat, stirring and tossing occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer toasted breadcrumbs to reserved rimmed baking sheet, spread into an even layer, and set aside to cool to room temperature; wipe out skillet. Once cool, set aside 1/2 cup (60g) toasted breadcrumbs for the pasta, and transfer remaining crumbs to an airtight container for future use; the extra breadcrumbs can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. 
 3. For the Pasta: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add cauliflower and cook at a rapid simmer, stirring occasionally, until floret pieces are very tender and offer no resistance when poked with a paring knife at thickest part of stem end, about 10 minutes. Using a spider skimmer, fine-mesh strainer, or slotted spoon, drain cauliflower while keeping boiling water in the pot; transfer cauliflower to a bowl or plate and set aside. 
 4. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup (60ml) oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add anchovies and cook, stirring and breaking up anchovies occasionally with a wooden spoon, until anchovies have dissolved, about 4 minutes. 
 5. Add cauliflower to skillet along with 1 cup (240ml) reserved cooking water, raisins, pine nuts, saffron, and fennel pollen (if using). Season lightly with salt, bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring and breaking up cauliflower with a wooden spoon, until florets break down to form a thick, yellow-tinged sauce (thanks to the saffron), 8 to 10 minutes. Add more cooking water in 1/4-cup (60ml) increments as needed to ensure there is enough liquid in the pan to coax cauliflower into breaking down into a saucy consistency. 
 6. Meanwhile, cook pasta in the reserved pot of boiling water used for cooking the cauliflower until pasta is just shy of al dente (about 2 minutes less than the package directs). Using a spider skimmer (or tongs if cooking bucatini), transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water. 
 7. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and cauliflower has broken down even further so that sauce coats noodles and pools around edges of the pan, about 2 minutes; add more pasta cooking water in 1/4-cup (60ml) increments as needed to achieve desired consistency. 
 8. Remove from heat, add half of the breadcrumbs (1/4 cup; 30g), and toss to combine. Pasta should be well-coated but not swimming in sauce (the sauce will continue to tighten up in the time it takes to plate and serve).

 1. Preheat oven to 300째F (150째C). Season short ribs all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add short ribs and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer browned short ribs to a platter and repeat with remaining short ribs. 
 2. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the Dutch oven. Return to the heat and add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring, until browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer; lower heat at any point if the contents of the pot threaten to burn. 
 3. Add dry red wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom and sides of pot. Bring to a simmer. Add stock; if using store-bought stock, place it in a large bowl first and sprinkle all over with gelatin until bloomed, then add to Dutch oven.

Working in batches, add short ribs and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer browned short ribs to a platter and repeat with remaining short ribs. 
 2. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the Dutch oven. Return to the heat and add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring, until browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer; lower heat at any point if the contents of the pot threaten to burn. 
 3. Add dry red wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom and sides of pot. Bring to a simmer. Add stock; if using store-bought stock, place it in a large bowl first and sprinkle all over with gelatin until bloomed, then add to Dutch oven. 
 4. Return short ribs to pot along with any accumulated juices, nestling them into braising liquids. Add thyme and bay leaves, cover partially, then transfer to oven, and cook until beef is fork-tender, 2 to 3 hours. 
 5. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, bring port to a very gentle simmer, regulating heat to maintain that simmer. Cook, uncovered, and reduce until syrupy, about 1 hour; should yield about 1/2 cup (120ml) in volume. Set aside. 
 6. Carefully remove short ribs from pot and transfer to a clean platter (they will be very tender, so the bones may slip out; try to hold them together as you transfer them). Tent with foil. 
 7. Skim accumulated fat from surface of braising liquid and discard. Strain braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large heatproof bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. 
 8. Rinse out Dutch oven, then return strained braising liquid to it. Return to heat and bring to a gentle simmer, adjusting heat to maintain simmer. Simmer until braising liquid is reduced to 2 cups, about 1 hour; skim any foam that accumulates on the surface as needed. Add port wine reduction to braising liquid. 
 9. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and leave a trail when you drag your finger through it. If it's still a little thin, whisk in the cornstarch slurry and bring to a simmer until thickened slightly. 
 10. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Return short ribs to Dutch oven, spooning the sauce all over and around them to glaze and rewarm.

 1. Heat oil in a wok to 350째F. Whisk together 1/2 cup cornstarch, flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Add water and vodka and whisk until a smooth batter is formed, adding up to 2 tablespoons additional water if batter is too thick. It should have the consistency of thin paint and fall off of the whisk in thin ribbons that instantly disappear as they hit the surface of the batter in the bowl. 
 2. Add tofu and carefully turn to coat. Working one at a time, lift one piece and allow excess batter to drip off. Carefully lower into hot oil. Repeat with remaining tofu until wok is full.

 1. To Prepare: Using a blender, food processor, or immersion blender, pur챕e blackberries until totally smooth. If seeds bother you, the pur챕e can be strained using a fine-mesh sieve; if you do plan to strain, add a couple extra blackberries to make up for the loss. Measure out exactly 6 ounces fresh blackberry pur챕e (about 3/4 cup; 170g) and bring to about 70째F (21째C) before using. 
 2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350째F (180째C). Lightly grease an 8- by 2-inch or 8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum cake pan and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here). 
 3. To Make the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment (see note), combine butter, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. With mixer still running, add egg whites a little at a time, letting each addition fully incorporate before proceeding to the next. 
 4. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about one-third of cake flour, followed by one-third of prepared blackberry pur챕e. Repeat with remaining flour and fruit, working in thirds as before. 
 5. Scrape bowl and beater with flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look bright purple and register between 65 and 68째F (18 and 20째C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.) If the batter looks streaky or tie-dyed, gently fold with a flexible spatula until streaks disappear.

 3. To Make the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment (see note), combine butter, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. With mixer still running, add egg whites a little at a time, letting each addition fully incorporate before proceeding to the next. 
 4. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about one-third of cake flour, followed by one-third of prepared blackberry pur챕e. Repeat with remaining flour and fruit, working in thirds as before. 
 5. Scrape bowl and beater with flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look bright purple and register between 65 and 68째F (18 and 20째C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.) If the batter looks streaky or tie-dyed, gently fold with a flexible spatula until streaks disappear. 
 6. Scrape into prepared pan, spread into an even layer, and bake until puffed and firm, about 30 minutes. Cool directly in pan for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen.

Press out excess air and seal zipper-lock bag, or cover dish with plastic or a lid. Refrigerate for 30 minutes; if chicken is in a dish, turn it once halfway through. 
 4. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade and wipe off any excess. In a stainless steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches if necessary to prevent crowding the pan, add the chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer cooked cutlets to a platter and cover with foil or place in a low oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining chicken, adding more oil if the pan gets too dry. 
 5. In the same skillet that you cooked the chicken, add more oil if the pan is dry and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion rings, season with salt, and saut챕 until the onions have softened a bit and started to brown, 7 to 10 minutes; lower heat and/or add a small splash of water if the contents of the pan threaten to burn. 
 6. Arrange cutlets on serving plates and top with browned onions.

 2. Run tomatoes under cold water, then remove and discard skins and seeds. Grate tomato flesh on largest holes of a box grater into a large heatproof mixing or serving bowl; it's okay if some slightly larger pieces of tomatoes remain. Add olive oil, basil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Stir well and season with salt to taste. Set aside. 
 3. Return water to a boil and season with salt. Cook spaghetti, stirring frequently, until al dente. When pasta has almost finished cooking, transfer 1/4 cup (30ml) pasta cooking water to tomato mixture and whisk to form an emulsion. 
 4. Using tongs, transfer pasta to tomato mixture along with an additional 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta cooking water. Vigorously toss and stir pasta to emulsify sauce and coat noodles.

 Context: Ingredients: 16 ounces fresh, 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, 4 cups semolina flour, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, 12 to 15 leaves sage 
 1. For the gnudi: Line a large plate with 3 layers of paper towels or a clean dish towel. Transfer ricotta directly to paper towels and spread with a rubber spatula. Place another triple layer of paper towels or a clean dish towel on top and press down firmly with the palms of your hands to blot excess moisture. Peel off upper paper towels. 
 2. Place a large bowl on a scale and zero the scale. Scrape ricotta into bowl to weigh. Remove excess ricotta to leave exactly 12 ounces. Reserve excess ricotta for another use. Add Parmesan and season heavily with black pepper. Combine mixture with a rubber spatula. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to a large clean plate and spread into a thin, even layer. Transfer to freezer and let chill for 15 minutes. 
 3. Meanwhile, transfer half of the semolina flour to a large bowl and the other half to a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. When ricotta is chilled, scrape it into a separate empty large bowl and fold it with a rubber spatula until no big chunks of frozen ricotta remain. Using a small cookie scoop, form a ball of ricotta about 1 1/2-inches wide (about 2 tablespoons) and transfer to the bowl with the flour. Using your fingers, scoop dry flour over the top of the ricotta ball. 
 4. Once the ball is coated, gently lift it and roll it around in your hands to form a neat sphere. Transfer it to the baking dish. Repeat with remaining ricotta. You should have about 16 to 20 finished gnudi. Sprinkle any remaining semolina in the bowl over the formed gnudi. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 and up to 3 days, turning the gnudi once per day. Once gnudi have formed a skin, they can be frozen. Transfer to a large plate or a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until solid, about 1 hour. Transfer to a zipper-lock freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to 2 months.

 Context: Ingredients: 16 ounces fresh, 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, 4 cups semolina flour, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, 12 to 15 leaves sage 
 1. For the gnudi: Line a large plate with 3 layers of paper towels or a clean dish towel. Transfer ricotta directly to paper towels and spread with a rubber spatula. Place another triple layer of paper towels or a clean dish towel on top and press down firmly with the palms of your hands to blot excess moisture. Peel off upper paper towels. 
 2. Place a large bowl on a scale and zero the scale. Scrape ricotta into bowl to weigh. Remove excess ricotta to leave exactly 12 ounces. Reserve excess ricotta for another use. Add Parmesan and season heavily with black pepper. Combine mixture with a rubber spatula. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to a large clean plate and spread into a thin, even layer. Transfer to freezer and let chill for 15 minutes. 
 3. Meanwhile, transfer half of the semolina flour to a large bowl and the other half to a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. When ricotta is chilled, scrape it into a separate empty large bowl and fold it with a rubber spatula until no big chunks of frozen ricotta remain. Using a small cookie scoop, form a ball of ricotta about 1 1/2-inches wide (about 2 tablespoons) and transfer to the bowl with the flour. Using your fingers, scoop dry flour over the top of the ricotta ball. 
 4. Once the ball is coated, gently lift it and roll it around in your hands to form a neat sphere. Transfer it to the baking dish. Repeat with remaining ricotta. You should have about 16 to 20 finished gnudi. Sprinkle any remaining semolina in the bowl over the formed gnudi. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 and up to 3 days, turning the gnudi once per day. Once gnudi have formed a skin, they can be frozen. Transfer to a large plate or a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until solid, about 1 hour. Transfer to a zipper-lock freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Allow to thaw on a plate covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator overnight before cooking. 
 5. To Cook and Serve: Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until foaming subsides, butter solids are golden brown, and butter has a nutty aroma. Add sage leaves, season lightly with salt, and cook, turning the leaves occasionally, until crisp, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the leaves to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve browned butter off-heat. 
 6. Place the remaining butter in a medium skillet. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add gnudi and cook, stirring very gently, for 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the gnudi to the skillet with the butter, making sure that plenty of pasta water gets into the pan with the gnudi. 
 7. Place the skillet over high heat and cook, shaking the pan and gently stirring the gnudi until the butter and pasta water emulsify into a creamy sauce, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt.

Working in batches, add short ribs and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer browned short ribs to a platter and repeat with remaining short ribs. 
 2. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the Dutch oven. Return to the heat and add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring, until browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer; lower heat at any point if the contents of the pot threaten to burn. 
 3. Add dry red wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom and sides of pot. Bring to a simmer. Add stock; if using store-bought stock, place it in a large bowl first and sprinkle all over with gelatin until bloomed, then add to Dutch oven. 
 4. Return short ribs to pot along with any accumulated juices, nestling them into braising liquids. Add thyme and bay leaves, cover partially, then transfer to oven, and cook until beef is fork-tender, 2 to 3 hours.

 Context: Ingredients: 5 pounds beef short ribs, 1 tablespoon vegetable, 2 ribs celery, 2 large carrots, 400 g yellow onion, 5 medium cloves garlic, 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 750 ml dry red wine, 940 ml chicken stock, 10 g unflavored gelatin, 4 sprigs fresh thyme, 750 ml ruby port wine, 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch 
 1. Preheat oven to 300째F (150째C). Season short ribs all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add short ribs and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer browned short ribs to a platter and repeat with remaining short ribs. 
 2. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the Dutch oven. Return to the heat and add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring, until browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute longer; lower heat at any point if the contents of the pot threaten to burn. 
 3. Add dry red wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom and sides of pot. Bring to a simmer. Add stock; if using store-bought stock, place it in a large bowl first and sprinkle all over with gelatin until bloomed, then add to Dutch oven. 
 4. Return short ribs to pot along with any accumulated juices, nestling them into braising liquids. Add thyme and bay leaves, cover partially, then transfer to oven, and cook until beef is fork-tender, 2 to 3 hours. 
 5. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, bring port to a very gentle simmer, regulating heat to maintain that simmer. Cook, uncovered, and reduce until syrupy, about 1 hour; should yield about 1/2 cup (120ml) in volume. Set aside. 
 6. Carefully remove short ribs from pot and transfer to a clean platter (they will be very tender, so the bones may slip out; try to hold them together as you transfer them). Tent with foil. 
 7. Skim accumulated fat from surface of braising liquid and discard. Strain braising liquid through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large heatproof bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. 
 8. Rinse out Dutch oven, then return strained braising liquid to it. Return to heat and bring to a gentle simmer, adjusting heat to maintain simmer. Simmer until braising liquid is reduced to 2 cups, about 1 hour; skim any foam that accumulates on the surface as needed. Add port wine reduction to braising liquid. 
 9. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and leave a trail when you drag your finger through it. If it's still a little thin, whisk in the cornstarch slurry and bring to a simmer until thickened slightly. 
 10. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Return short ribs to Dutch oven, spooning the sauce all over and around them to glaze and rewarm.

"If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round.",a traditional cake pan of those dimensions,"Question: What can I use if I don't have the recommended pan? 
 Context: Ingredients: 7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, 1 ounce unsalted butter, 32 ounces cream cheese, 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 ounce vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water, 2 cups sugar, 6 large eggs, 6 ounces heavy cream, 16 ounces blueberries, 1/2 cup Fruit 
 1. Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here. 
 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. 
 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more. 
 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145째F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.",a traditional cake pan of those dimensions,5,preparation

 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. 
 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more. 
 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145째F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.","cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here.",5,cooking_technique

This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145째F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.","With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan.",5,cooking_technique

 Context: Ingredients: 7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, 1 ounce unsalted butter, 32 ounces cream cheese, 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 ounce vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water, 2 cups sugar, 6 large eggs, 6 ounces heavy cream, 16 ounces blueberries, 1/2 cup Fruit 
 1. Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here. 
 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time.

Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice.

 Context: Ingredients: 7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, 1 ounce unsalted butter, 32 ounces cream cheese, 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 ounce vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water, 2 cups sugar, 6 large eggs, 6 ounces heavy cream, 16 ounces blueberries, 1/2 cup Fruit 
 1. Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here. 
 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. 
 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more. 
 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes.

Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional).

 Context: Ingredients: 7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, 1 ounce unsalted butter, 32 ounces cream cheese, 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 ounce vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water, 2 cups sugar, 6 large eggs, 6 ounces heavy cream, 16 ounces blueberries, 1/2 cup Fruit 
 1. Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here. 
 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. 
 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more. 
 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145째F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate.

 Context: Ingredients: 7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, 1 ounce unsalted butter, 32 ounces cream cheese, 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 ounce vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water, 2 cups sugar, 6 large eggs, 6 ounces heavy cream, 16 ounces blueberries, 1/2 cup Fruit 
 1. Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here. 
 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. 
 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more. 
 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145째F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional).

Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here. 
 2. If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan. 
 3. For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. 
 4. For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450째F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. 
 5. Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more. 
 6. In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking. 
 7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250째F until done; this may take an hour or more. 
 8. Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250째F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145째F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. 
 9. Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours. 
 10. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 11. Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days. 
 12. To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.","Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice.",5,cooking_technique
