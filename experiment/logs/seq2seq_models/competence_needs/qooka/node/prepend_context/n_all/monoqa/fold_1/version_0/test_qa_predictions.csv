You should be able to watch the heat penetrate the fish from each side because tuna changes color so dramatically, from a deep purple when raw to a beige when cooked. Use the side of the fish to gauge doneness: if you want it very rare in the center, the sides of the steaks should still look purple, with the color of the cooked fish just starting to creep in from above and below. If you want it a little more done, let the cooked color creep up a bit more from both sides. We don't recommend cooking tuna steaks beyond medium-rare.","If you want it a little more done, let the cooked color creep up a bit more from both sides.","true If you want it a little more done, let the cooked color creep up a bit more from both sides.",-9.298280929215252e-06,0,"If you want it a little more done, let the cooked color creep up a bit more from both sides."
