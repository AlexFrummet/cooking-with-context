Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough,old-fashioned flaky pie dough,"Question: what kind of dough do I need to make? 
 Context: Ingredients: 1/2 batch Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, 680 g peaches, 1 ounce tapioca starch, 3 1/2 ounces sugar, 1 large egg, 1 large egg yolk, 1/2 ounce heavy cream, 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 ounce silver rum 
 1. Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined aluminum rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough, at least 2 hours or up to 24. 
 2. For the Filling: Wash peaches (no need to peel) and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Measure out 18 ounces (3 cups; 510g) in a medium bowl. Enjoy any extras as a snack; do not use more or you will overcrowd the pie. Sprinkle tapioca starch over peaches and toss until well combined. 
 3. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F. Arrange peaches in a ring in the center of chilled dough, tiling slices like dominoes and leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. Sprinkle sugar on top of peaches and finish with a pinch of salt. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from fruit to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over peaches, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate pie while you prepare egg wash, but no longer than 15 minutes. 
 4. For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together. 
 5. Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes, then pause to brush rum over any undissolved pockets of sugar. (If sugar is well dissolved, just brush it over the sugar anyway.) Continue baking until golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 15 minutes longer.

 2. For the Filling: Wash peaches (no need to peel) and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Measure out 18 ounces (3 cups; 510g) in a medium bowl. Enjoy any extras as a snack; do not use more or you will overcrowd the pie. Sprinkle tapioca starch over peaches and toss until well combined. 
 3. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F. Arrange peaches in a ring in the center of chilled dough, tiling slices like dominoes and leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. Sprinkle sugar on top of peaches and finish with a pinch of salt. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from fruit to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over peaches, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate pie while you prepare egg wash, but no longer than 15 minutes. 
 4. For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together. 
 5. Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes, then pause to brush rum over any undissolved pockets of sugar. (If sugar is well dissolved, just brush it over the sugar anyway.) Continue baking until golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 15 minutes longer. Let cool 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve warm, with a side of whipped cream if desired.","Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes",45,time

 Context: Ingredients: 285 g all-purpose flour, 5 g instant yeast, 1/8 teaspoon baking soda, 6 g kosher salt, 5 ounces unsalted butter, 60 g sugar, 140 g plain Greek yogurt, 1 large egg, 3 ounces walnuts, 70 g all-purpose flour, 60 g sugar, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 60 g unsalted butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 large egg 
 1. For the Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, yeast, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, using a stiff rubber spatula, vigorously stir butter and sugar together to form a uniform paste. Add flour mixture to butter mixture; wipe out bowl that had flour mixture, lightly grease with cooking spray or butter, and set aside. Using spatula followed by hands, mix flour and butter mixtures together until even, cornmeal-like mixture forms, 1 to 2 minutes. 
 2. Add yogurt and egg, and, using spatula followed by hands, stir until stiff, even dough forms, about 2 minutes. Transfer dough to the prepared lightly greased medium bowl and cover tightly. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours, and up to 16 hours. 
 3. For the Filling: In a medium bowl, stir together walnuts, flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and vanilla extract and, using a rubber spatula, stir until clumpy paste forms and no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds. Cover and store at room temperature until ready to assemble. 
 4. To Finish and Bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer dough to clean, lightly-floured surface, and dust top of dough lightly with flour. Using hands, gently press dough into even 6-inch circle, adding flour to both sides of dough as needed to prevent sticking, while pinching closed any major cracks in dough that form. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. 
 5. Place filling in center of dough and, using clean hands and rubber spatula, spread into an even 5-inch round disc, leaving a 3 1/2-inch border of dough on all sides. Starting at one edge, using your hands, fold and pleat dough over filling toward center, working your way around disc. Pinch and press pleats together to fully enclose filling. Press top of dough gently to form an even 6-inch round. Invert so seam side is facing down and, using a rolling pin, gently roll into an even 9-inch round. Carefully transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone baking mat.

 Context: Ingredients: 1/2 batch Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, 680 g peaches, 1 ounce tapioca starch, 3 1/2 ounces sugar, 1 large egg, 1 large egg yolk, 1/2 ounce heavy cream, 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 ounce silver rum 
 1. Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined aluminum rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough, at least 2 hours or up to 24. 
 2. For the Filling: Wash peaches (no need to peel) and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Measure out 18 ounces (3 cups; 510g) in a medium bowl. Enjoy any extras as a snack; do not use more or you will overcrowd the pie. Sprinkle tapioca starch over peaches and toss until well combined. 
 3. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F. Arrange peaches in a ring in the center of chilled dough, tiling slices like dominoes and leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. Sprinkle sugar on top of peaches and finish with a pinch of salt. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from fruit to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over peaches, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate pie while you prepare egg wash, but no longer than 15 minutes. 
 4. For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together. 
 5. Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes, then pause to brush rum over any undissolved pockets of sugar. (If sugar is well dissolved, just brush it over the sugar anyway.)

Arrange peaches in a ring in the center of chilled dough, tiling slices like dominoes and leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. Sprinkle sugar on top of peaches and finish with a pinch of salt. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from fruit to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over peaches, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate pie while you prepare egg wash, but no longer than 15 minutes. 
 4. For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together. 
 5. Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes, then pause to brush rum over any undissolved pockets of sugar. (If sugar is well dissolved, just brush it over the sugar anyway.) Continue baking until golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 15 minutes longer.

 Context: Ingredients: 800 g boneless skinless chicken thighs, 380 g plain unsweetened yogurt, 100 g scallions, 20 g mint leaves and stems, 12 whole black peppercorns, 15 g garlic cloves, 30 g fresh ginger, 1 chile Serrano, 1 teaspoon ground turmeric, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 teaspoons coriander seeds, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons honey, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon chile flakes, 420 g yellow nectarines, 2 tablespoons picked thyme leaves and very tender stems 
 1. To Marinate the Chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, score the top side of the chicken thighs 2 or 3 times, then prick all over with a fork. Place the chicken in a baking dish, ziptop bag, or a food-safe storage container with a lid. 
 2. In a blender, combine yogurt, scallions, mint, peppercorns, garlic, ginger, chile, turmeric, and salt. Pulse until very smooth. Pour the yogurt mixture all over the chicken, then gently toss to coat well. Cover the container or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. 
 3. To Pickle the Nectarines: Heat a small dry skillet over medium heat. Add the coriander seeds to the hot skillet and toast until the seeds become fragrant and start to darken slightly, about 1 minute. Transfer toasted coriander seeds to a mortar and pestle and crush to a coarse powder. 
 4. In a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar, honey, and salt until combined. Stir in the chile flakes and coriander powder. 
 5. Cut the nectarines in half and remove and discard the stone. Cut the nectarines into thin segments and add them to the vinegar mixture along with the thyme. Stir to coat the fruit well. Cover with a lid and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day before serving. 
 6. To Cook the Chicken: When ready to cook, position oven racks in both the bottom-middle and top-middle positions and heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two rimmed baking sheets with foil and spray the foil with a little oil. Spread the marinated thighs over the prepared baking sheets, 4 pieces per sheet. Bake the chicken, switching the positions of the two sheets halfway through cooking, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the thighs and the edges are slightly browned, about 30 minutes.

cold water,cold water,"Question: How should I prepare the chickpeas for soaking? Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. what do I cover the chickpeas with? 
 Context: Ingredients: 225 g dried chickpeas, 55 g fresh cilantro, 55 g scallions, 2 cloves garlic, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seed, 10 g kosher salt, 2 cups vegetable oil 
 1. Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner. 
 2. Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more. 
 3. Transfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This will help the balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand.

 1. For the Chili Gravy: Heat a heavy 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cut all the chilies open along one side, so that they can be laid flat. Working in batches, cook chilies in the skillet, pressing down with a spatula, until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 seconds on each side; be careful not to let chilies burn. Transfer to a large bowl and cover chilies with hot water, setting a small plate on top to keep them submerged. Let stand 30 minutes. 
 2. Meanwhile, add ground beef to cast-iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl and set aside. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of beef fat from skillet; if there isn’t enough fat leftover in the skillet, add enough oil to make up the difference. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in mined garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion and garlic to a blender. 
 3. Drain chilies, discarding all of the soaking liquid. Transfer chilies to the blender with onions and garlic, and add cumin, oregano, black pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 cup chicken stock. Blend mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides with a spatula occasionally, about 1 to 2 minutes on high. If the mixture won’t blend, add another 1/2 cup of stock. 
 4. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, press chili mixture through a mesh strainer set over a large bow until only chili skins remain in strainer. Discard skins. 
 5. Heat oil in cast-iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add flour and stir immediately with a wire whisk. Continue to stir until roux turns light golden brown.

 2. Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor.

Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand. Gently shape each into a ball (you will not be able to roll the mixture like cookie dough; this is okay) and place them on a clean plate.
