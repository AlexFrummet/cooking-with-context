chilled,old-fashioned flaky pie dough,"Question: what kind of dough do I need to make? 
 Context: Ingredients: 1/2 batch Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, 680 g peaches, 1 ounce tapioca starch, 3 1/2 ounces sugar, 1 large egg, 1 large egg yolk, 1/2 ounce heavy cream, 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 ounce silver rum 
 1. Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined aluminum rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough, at least 2 hours or up to 24. 
 2. For the Filling: Wash peaches (no need to peel) and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Measure out 18 ounces (3 cups; 510g) in a medium bowl. Enjoy any extras as a snack; do not use more or you will overcrowd the pie. Sprinkle tapioca starch over peaches and toss until well combined. 
 3. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F. Arrange peaches in a ring in the center of chilled dough, tiling slices like dominoes and leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. Sprinkle sugar on top of peaches and finish with a pinch of salt. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from fruit to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over peaches, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate pie while you prepare egg wash, but no longer than 15 minutes. 
 4. For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together. 
 5. Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes, then pause to brush rum over any undissolved pockets of sugar. (If sugar is well dissolved, just brush it over the sugar anyway.) Continue baking until golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 15 minutes longer. Let cool 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve warm, with a side of whipped cream if desired.",old-fashioned flaky pie dough,45

 2. Add yogurt and egg, and, using spatula followed by hands, stir until stiff, even dough forms, about 2 minutes. Transfer dough to the prepared lightly greased medium bowl and cover tightly. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours, and up to 16 hours. 
 3. For the Filling: In a medium bowl, stir together walnuts, flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and vanilla extract and, using a rubber spatula, stir until clumpy paste forms and no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds. Cover and store at room temperature until ready to assemble. 
 4. To Finish and Bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer dough to clean, lightly-floured surface, and dust top of dough lightly with flour. Using hands, gently press dough into even 6-inch circle, adding flour to both sides of dough as needed to prevent sticking, while pinching closed any major cracks in dough that form. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. 
 5. Place filling in center of dough and, using clean hands and rubber spatula, spread into an even 5-inch round disc, leaving a 3 1/2-inch border of dough on all sides. Starting at one edge, using your hands, fold and pleat dough over filling toward center, working your way around disc. Pinch and press pleats together to fully enclose filling. Press top of dough gently to form an even 6-inch round. Invert so seam side is facing down and, using a rolling pin, gently roll into an even 9-inch round. Carefully transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone baking mat. 
 6. Pinch dough around the edge of the gata between the index finger of one hand and thumb and index finger of the other hand to form decorative points, spaced about 1 inch apart. Brush top and sides of gata evenly with egg wash. Using a fork, drag flat underside of fork across top of gata to form grooved lines in a crisscross pattern, spaced about 1 inch apart. Using a toothpick, poke 8 to 10 evenly spaced holes in top of dough, stopping when you reach the filling. Bake until evenly golden brown, 28 to 35 minutes, rotating baking sheet after 20 minutes. 
 7. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let gata cool for at least 20 minutes. Slice into wedges, and serve.",20 minutes,42

 1. Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined aluminum rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough, at least 2 hours or up to 24. 
 2. For the Filling: Wash peaches (no need to peel) and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Measure out 18 ounces (3 cups; 510g) in a medium bowl. Enjoy any extras as a snack; do not use more or you will overcrowd the pie. Sprinkle tapioca starch over peaches and toss until well combined. 
 3. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F. Arrange peaches in a ring in the center of chilled dough, tiling slices like dominoes and leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. Sprinkle sugar on top of peaches and finish with a pinch of salt. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from fruit to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over peaches, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate pie while you prepare egg wash, but no longer than 15 minutes. 
 4. For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together. 
 5. Bake until pie is quite juicy, about 20 minutes, then pause to brush rum over any undissolved pockets of sugar. (If sugar is well dissolved, just brush it over the sugar anyway.) Continue baking until golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 15 minutes longer.

 Context: Ingredients: 225 g dried chickpeas, 55 g fresh cilantro, 55 g scallions, 2 cloves garlic, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seed, 10 g kosher salt, 2 cups vegetable oil 
 1. Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner. 
 2. Combine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more.

 1. For the Chili Gravy: Heat a heavy 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cut all the chilies open along one side, so that they can be laid flat. Working in batches, cook chilies in the skillet, pressing down with a spatula, until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 seconds on each side; be careful not to let chilies burn. Transfer to a large bowl and cover chilies with hot water, setting a small plate on top to keep them submerged. Let stand 30 minutes. 
 2. Meanwhile, add ground beef to cast-iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl and set aside.

 1. For the Chili Gravy: Heat a heavy 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cut all the chilies open along one side, so that they can be laid flat. Working in batches, cook chilies in the skillet, pressing down with a spatula, until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 seconds on each side; be careful not to let chilies burn. Transfer to a large bowl and cover chilies with hot water, setting a small plate on top to keep them submerged. Let stand 30 minutes. 
 2. Meanwhile, add ground beef to cast-iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl and set aside. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of beef fat from skillet; if there isn’t enough fat leftover in the skillet, add enough oil to make up the difference. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in mined garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion and garlic to a blender. 
 3. Drain chilies, discarding all of the soaking liquid. Transfer chilies to the blender with onions and garlic, and add cumin, oregano, black pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 cup chicken stock. Blend mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides with a spatula occasionally, about 1 to 2 minutes on high. If the mixture won’t blend, add another 1/2 cup of stock. 
 4. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, press chili mixture through a mesh strainer set over a large bow until only chili skins remain in strainer. Discard skins. 
 5. Heat oil in cast-iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add flour and stir immediately with a wire whisk. Continue to stir until roux turns light golden brown.

Transfer the fried tortilla to a paper towel-line plate to drain. 
 7. Working 1 tortilla at a time, dip fried tortilla into sauce, then transfer to a plate. Arrange 1/4 cup of cheese and 1 tablespoon chopped onions in a line along center of tortilla, then roll up.

 Context: Ingredients: 2 ounces dried Ancho chiles, 2 ounces dried Guajillo chiles, 2 chiles dried Arbol, 1/2 pound ground beef, 1 medium yellow onion, 6 medium garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 4 cups low-sodium broth, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1 pound cheddar cheese, 1 cup chopped yellow onion 
 1. For the Chili Gravy: Heat a heavy 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cut all the chilies open along one side, so that they can be laid flat. Working in batches, cook chilies in the skillet, pressing down with a spatula, until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 seconds on each side; be careful not to let chilies burn. Transfer to a large bowl and cover chilies with hot water, setting a small plate on top to keep them submerged. Let stand 30 minutes. 
 2. Meanwhile, add ground beef to cast-iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl and set aside. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of beef fat from skillet; if there isn’t enough fat leftover in the skillet, add enough oil to make up the difference. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in mined garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion and garlic to a blender. 
 3. Drain chilies, discarding all of the soaking liquid. Transfer chilies to the blender with onions and garlic, and add cumin, oregano, black pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 cup chicken stock. Blend mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides with a spatula occasionally, about 1 to 2 minutes on high. If the mixture won’t blend, add another 1/2 cup of stock. 
 4. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, press chili mixture through a mesh strainer set over a large bow until only chili skins remain in strainer. Discard skins. 
 5. Heat oil in cast-iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add flour and stir immediately with a wire whisk. Continue to stir until roux turns light golden brown. Add chili mixture and stir in remaining broth and ground beef. Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a slow and steady simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is dark red and thick like a gravy, about 30 minutes. If too thick, add a little water to thin it out. 
 6. Meanwhile, For the Cheese Enchiladas: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375°F. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working 1 tortilla at a time, carefully slide tortillas into oil and cook, turning once, until just starting to look leathery, about 5 to 10 seconds per side; avoid frying too long, as overly crisp tortillas will crack when folded. Transfer the fried tortilla to a paper towel-line plate to drain. 
 7. Working 1 tortilla at a time, dip fried tortilla into sauce, then transfer to a plate. Arrange 1/4 cup of cheese and 1 tablespoon chopped onions in a line along center of tortilla, then roll up.

 Context: Ingredients: 285 g all-purpose flour, 5 g instant yeast, 1/8 teaspoon baking soda, 6 g kosher salt, 5 ounces unsalted butter, 60 g sugar, 140 g plain Greek yogurt, 1 large egg, 3 ounces walnuts, 70 g all-purpose flour, 60 g sugar, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 60 g unsalted butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 large egg 
 1. For the Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, yeast, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, using a stiff rubber spatula, vigorously stir butter and sugar together to form a uniform paste. Add flour mixture to butter mixture; wipe out bowl that had flour mixture, lightly grease with cooking spray or butter, and set aside. Using spatula followed by hands, mix flour and butter mixtures together until even, cornmeal-like mixture forms, 1 to 2 minutes. 
 2. Add yogurt and egg, and, using spatula followed by hands, stir until stiff, even dough forms, about 2 minutes. Transfer dough to the prepared lightly greased medium bowl and cover tightly. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours, and up to 16 hours. 
 3. For the Filling: In a medium bowl, stir together walnuts, flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and vanilla extract and, using a rubber spatula, stir until clumpy paste forms and no dry flour remains, about 30 seconds. Cover and store at room temperature until ready to assemble. 
 4. To Finish and Bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer dough to clean, lightly-floured surface, and dust top of dough lightly with flour. Using hands, gently press dough into even 6-inch circle, adding flour to both sides of dough as needed to prevent sticking, while pinching closed any major cracks in dough that form. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. 
 5. Place filling in center of dough and, using clean hands and rubber spatula, spread into an even 5-inch round disc, leaving a 3 1/2-inch border of dough on all sides. Starting at one edge, using your hands, fold and pleat dough over filling toward center, working your way around disc. Pinch and press pleats together to fully enclose filling. Press top of dough gently to form an even 6-inch round. Invert so seam side is facing down and, using a rolling pin, gently roll into an even 9-inch round. Carefully transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone baking mat. 
 6. Pinch dough around the edge of the gata between the index finger of one hand and thumb and index finger of the other hand to form decorative points, spaced about 1 inch apart. Brush top and sides of gata evenly with egg wash. Using a fork, drag flat underside of fork across top of gata to form grooved lines in a crisscross pattern, spaced about 1 inch apart. Using a toothpick, poke 8 to 10 evenly spaced holes in top of dough, stopping when you reach the filling. Bake until evenly golden brown, 28 to 35 minutes, rotating baking sheet after 20 minutes.
